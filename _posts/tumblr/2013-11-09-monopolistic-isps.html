<p>I am on the lowest tier of TWC broadband in NYC and I feel like I&rsquo;m connecting from a third world country. For $20 a month I don&rsquo;t expect the fastest internet, but I expect it to be just as reliable as the next persons internet. One thing I&rsquo;m not going to do is pay more to the same people who can&rsquo;t provide decent service in the first place.</p>
<p>Net neutrality is something that has become a hot button issue these days and I&rsquo;m not looking forward to the day when my ISP can tell me what websites I have access to.</p>
<p>I want to propose a solution. <strong>I would pay two internet service providers</strong> if I had a device that split my requests, served me the first response, and reported detailed statistics to me and a carefully constructed internet watchdog group. Of course this solution goes downhill if ISPs team up on their evil ways, but that would be a good reason to declare them an actual monopoly and bust them up.</p>
