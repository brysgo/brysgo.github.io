<p>Those of you who know me already know I am a man of many wishes and <a href="http://vimeo.com/55277669">dreams</a>. That means as a developer, I dream up, try to start, and abandon many&hellip;many projects.</p>
<p>When I work occasionally to get these projects out of my head and into code, I will pull on any open source threads I am given. The really cool part about this is I usually end up finding the people who are already trying to do what I am setting out to do. Most of the time, they are <a href="https://github.com/trending">way ahead of me</a>.</p>
<p>My usual course of action is to <a href="https://github.com/brysgo?tab=repositories">abandon yet another project</a> and move on with my life, knowing full well that it meant forgetting about the hand full of cool (from my perspective at least) feature sets I had planned for my project that did not match up with the one I found.</p>

<p>No more! Henceforth, I will provide at no cost (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzp4gnxgWxc">worth the price</a>), my good advice. Posts will be wishlist themed and tweeted aggressively at the company I think is closest to my fantasy product.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve been warned. :-D</p>
