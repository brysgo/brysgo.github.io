<p>I’ve decided to write a blog post every day, even if it is crappy. Why? Is it so I can feel important? Maybe, but I would never admit that. The reason I’m sticking to is that I want to get better at reflecting on important parts of my day.</p>

<p>It may help me appreciate all the interesting things I come across daily that are quickly relegated to a distant memory. Especially the seemingly mundane things I tend to take for granted. Writing about my day will help give meaning to at least one special thing that happened.</p>

<p>It may help me learn from my experiences. No one is perfect, especially your’s truly. Writing about things from my day can help me learn by examining things I could have done better. Additionally, people around me can read and point out flaws in my reasoning.</p>

<p>It may help me articulate my point of view. I did a ton of thinking and reasoning as a child outside of school. I even learned to program without talking to anyone about it. While I’ve spent many years working on it, there is still a gap between my ability to reason and my ability to verbalize abstract concepts.</p>

<p>It may help others understand me better. It’s easy to point a finger and call someone who is slightly unconventional mad, but if you look closer you’ll see there is a method to my madness.</p>

<p>tl;dr - Apologies if you get trapped reading my blog and have trouble getting your wasted time back, it’s for me, not you.</p>
