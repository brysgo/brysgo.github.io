<p>Google calendar has many features I rely on, one of my favorites is the integration with Google now that helps you get where you need to go on time.</p>

<p>I use the to make sure I always leave time for the subway. However, sometimes my trips are a little longer. Google already knows when I&rsquo;m going on a flight, why not add trips to my calendar.</p>

<p>If I&rsquo;m going on a train to long island two hours of my time are spent on the train. How do I put those into my calendar in a way that Google will help me the most.</p>

<p>If you give me a way to put trips into my Google calendar, I&rsquo;ll buy you a drink.</p>
