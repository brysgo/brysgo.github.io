<p><span>As a New Yorker, I often feel guilty for how filthy it is and how there are people who have to live on our filthy streets.</span></p>
<p><span>I try to give (not on the street) like a good person, but I always feel like it isn’t enough. So I did what I do everyday and attempted to solve my problems with emotionless calculations.</span></p>
<p><span>I’m not super religious, but the first place I look when I’m in a moral dilemma is to my religion. I vaguely remember from pre-school that one of the commandments (the extended version) instructs us to leave the corners of our fields.</span></p>
<p><span>Here comes the math. The area of a circle, the shape used to plow a field, is πr^</span><span>2</span><span> and the formula for a square (the presumed average shape of a field) is x^</span><span>2</span><span>.</span></p>
<p><span><img src="https://31.media.tumblr.com/769ec843225540e5a8cd57427af73d20/tumblr_inline_ni70sty2sf1r60sb8.jpg"/></span></p>

<p><span><!-- more --></span></p>
<p><span>There are two radii in the side of a field, so the square formula becomes (2r)^</span><span>2</span><span>.</span></p>
<p><span>Now the ratio is πr^</span><span>2 </span><span>/ (2r)^</span><span>2</span></p>
<p><span>Distribute the square and it becomes πr^</span><span>2 </span><span>/ 4r^</span><span>2</span></p>
<p><span>Now the r^</span><span>2</span><span> cancels leaving us with a constant!!</span></p>
<p><span>π / 4</span></p>
<p><span>What does that constant mean? Well if we were leaving the corners of our field for the poor, π / 4 is how much of our produce we would be taking home. So how much does that leave for charity?</span></p>
<p><span>1 - π / 4</span></p>
<p><span>Okay great, so I just need to give that much charity. So lets say Sally makes 60K a year after taxes, how much does she need to give to live up to the commandments?</span></p>
<p><span>(1 - π / 4) * $60,000 = $12,876.11</span></p>
