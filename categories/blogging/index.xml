I'm not going to be so rigid with my every day blog promise, but I will make an effort where possible. Also, I plan on doing something which I haven't done before which is try to keep my blog posts up to date.
If you go back through my blog posts you will see edits and updates to make sure I can stay proud of my blog instead of being unconfident of stale blog posts.</description></item><item><title>Blogs on blogs on blogs</title><link>http://brysgo.com/2014/11/15/if-i-write-a-blog-in-the-forest-does-it-make-a/</link><pubDate>Sat, 15 Nov 2014 13:41:46 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://brysgo.com/2014/11/15/if-i-write-a-blog-in-the-forest-does-it-make-a/</guid><description>I’ve decided to write a blog post every day, even if it is crappy. Why? Is it so I can feel important? Maybe, but I would never admit that. The reason I’m sticking to is that I want to get better at reflecting on important parts of my day.
It may help me appreciate all the interesting things I come across daily that are quickly relegated to a distant memory.</description></item></channel></rss>
