Problem is the search key is really sexy, and while I can make the control key the search key, it just isn&amp;rsquo;t the same. Also, sometimes I actually try and use Ctrl like a control key and everything is wonky.
So here is my request. I want to be able to set the search key to bring up the search if I havenâ€™t pressed any keys in combination with it, but if I have, it should act like a control key.</description></item><item><title>Wishlist: Google Calendar Trips</title><link>//www.brysgo.com/2014/12/23/wishlist-google-calendar-trips/</link><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2014 15:24:53 +0000</pubDate><guid>//www.brysgo.com/2014/12/23/wishlist-google-calendar-trips/</guid><description>Google calendar has many features I rely on, one of my favorites is the integration with Google now that helps you get where you need to go on time.
I use the to make sure I always leave time for the subway. However, sometimes my trips are a little longer. Google already knows when I&amp;rsquo;m going on a flight, why not add trips to my calendar.
If I&amp;rsquo;m going on a train to long island two hours of my time are spent on the train.</description></item><item><title>Wishlist: Coding in the Cloud (without falling from the sky)</title><link>//www.brysgo.com/2014/07/28/wishlist-coding-in-the-cloud-without-falling/</link><pubDate>Mon, 28 Jul 2014 09:01:01 +0000</pubDate><guid>//www.brysgo.com/2014/07/28/wishlist-coding-in-the-cloud-without-falling/</guid><description>As a diehard Google fanboy, it is my duty to figure out how I can switch to a Chromebook as my primary laptop. The only way I can see myself doing that is if I were provided a web based programming experience that was better than coding on metal.
Enter Bryan&amp;rsquo;s fantasy world, where a flourishing space economy affords us with cheap vacations to the moon and once a year visits to grandma on the mars colony.</description></item><item><title>Wishlist Series</title><link>//www.brysgo.com/2014/07/27/wishlist-series/</link><pubDate>Sun, 27 Jul 2014 21:55:14 +0000</pubDate><guid>//www.brysgo.com/2014/07/27/wishlist-series/</guid><description>Those of you who know me already know I am a man of many wishes and dreams. That means as a developer, I dream up, try to start, and abandon many&amp;hellip;many projects. When I work occasionally to get these projects out of my head and into code, I will pull on any open source threads I am given. The really cool part about this is I usually end up finding the people who are already trying to do what I am setting out to do.</description></item></channel></rss>
