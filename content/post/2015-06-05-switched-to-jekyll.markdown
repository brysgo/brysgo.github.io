Just switched my blog to Jekyll because it is easier to manage. I will probably continue using tumblr here and there to reblog interesting things, but not to write my posts.

Also didn't feel like deleting the intro post, so here it is...

> You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.
>
> To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.
>
> Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:
>
{{< highlight ruby >}}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{{< / highlight >}}
