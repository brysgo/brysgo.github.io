Now I know this isn't [my first time promising more blog time][blog-a-day] but I'm renewing my vows.

I'm not going to be so rigid with my every day blog promise, but I will make an effort where possible. Also,
I plan on doing something which I haven't done before which is try to keep my blog posts up to date.

If you go back through my blog posts you will see edits and updates to make sure I can stay proud of my blog
instead of being unconfident of stale blog posts.
