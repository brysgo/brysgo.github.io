> [Relay][relay-preview] is out in preview! Have a look.

I want to tell you in as few words as possible why I am so excited to get my
hands on [Relay][relay] and [GraphQL][graphql].

React is widely popular because it is simple and declarative, making it very
deterministic and easy to work with. React is also fully composable, making
it imensly powerful with high potential for writing reusable code.

Relay is a mirror image of React, except instead of composing beautiful views
for the web and native mobile devices using JSX, you can compose data from your
database for your views using graphql.
