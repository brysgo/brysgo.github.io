@sdrausty - I'm so frustrated >< https://twitter.com/brysgo/status/927162173331267584
 Bryan Goldstein @brysgo
Why is linux still multi-user? No one shares a machine anymore, and every userland application/service has a better authorization system.

well it makes sense in servers and institutions
where Linux is most used

Bryan Goldstein @brysgo 08:23
maybe institutions
where lots of people log into the same linux servers
but I feel like that is really only CS departments at schools
everyone else is using linux to host their other services with built in authz
or
they are using it to build modern operating systems, like android, ios, chrome os, that have application level security
there isn't really a place in the future for an operating system that everybody logs into
everyone has like a hundred devices

Sofia @Soph1a7 08:25
don't forget the enterprise

Bryan Goldstein @brysgo 08:25
and we log into specific services
I'm not

Sofia @Soph1a7 08:25
where one or multiple servers are shared

Bryan Goldstein @brysgo 08:25
I actually do tech consulting for enterprise
and they still wouldn't have employees log into a linux system with multiple users
there are some exceptions
don't get me wrong
some systems are built with their authz leveraging unix permissions because it is there
but there is absolutely no reason for it to be coupled to the OS
since all of these things are services built on top of the os
and OS security would be much better if it worried about applications interfering with eachother rather than users
because most users have no clue what they are doing, and will install random stuff from people who do

this caused me to write a blog post :grinning: http://www.brysgo.com/post/2017-11-05-multi-user-systems/

BrainDamage services in linux are still divided among multiple users for a human user, this allows to reduce the amount of priviledges given them and the attack surface in exchange for increased complexity
BrainDamage and even when there's not a deliberate attack there's also the accidental damage from user or bugs
BrainDamage even windows will not let you run everything as admin by default anymore
BrainDamage if anything, machines are becoming MORE multi-user, just that the users aren't human

Bryan Goldstein @brysgo 10:27
But is accidental error what we should be building our security for? I would give the post a read

IRC/Gitter bot @TermuxBot 10:29
BrainDamage i read it, containers are another way to do it, but they come with considerable complexity themselves since you need to give programs an environment to work in
BrainDamage also accidental error was only one of the points
BrainDamage and it's true that linux lacks a better auth model, but good luck writing it, cgroups was supposed to be, but it's not done

Bryan Goldstein @brysgo 10:30
Right, but programs should be where the authorization is focused
Not users
We are no longer protecting our systems from users, we are protecting them from the software we install

IRC/Gitter bot @TermuxBot 10:32
BrainDamage users abstraction is going to be kept, your user case was for a personal device, the majority of computers is actually multi-seated servers
BrainDamage desktop/phone centric distros indeed can benefit from a more program-oriented security model

Bryan Goldstein @brysgo 10:38
The server case, I argued it should absolutely not rely on the OS for authorization
I'm just repeating what was written, but how many times do you log directly into a multi user Unix machine?

IRC/Gitter bot @TermuxBot 10:39
BrainDamage i don't see that in the link

Bryan Goldstein @brysgo 10:40
"When was the last time you logged into a multi-user unix system that had other users on it? Was it in your CS department in college? Me too."

IRC/Gitter bot @TermuxBot 10:41
BrainDamage no, 'The server case, I argued it should absolutely not rely on the OS for authorization' < this
BrainDamage do you mean the example where you swap operative system?
BrainDamage there's a limit to the abstraction
BrainDamage if all os were generic and swappable, the situation would be far off what we have no
BrainDamage now
BrainDamage and authorization and permissions are tightly coupled with the base principles of the os ( filesystem structure, etc )

Bryan Goldstein @brysgo 10:44
Right, but for building services, that doesn't make sense

IRC/Gitter bot @TermuxBot 10:45
BrainDamage oh and for the record, the last time I've logged into a multiseat server was yesterday
BrainDamage and no, I'm not in CS

Bryan Goldstein @brysgo 10:45
Would you mind explaining what the system was for?
Because it seems to be more the exception

IRC/Gitter bot @TermuxBot 10:46
BrainDamage i did it twice, one was a game server where i have a small slot allocated for a game i help with, another was a computing cluster to dispatch a job

Bryan Goldstein @brysgo 10:49
And for the game server, is there a reason the game doesn't handle authorization?

IRC/Gitter bot @TermuxBot 10:49
BrainDamage it's a server which hosts multiple services for the game
BrainDamage the game is a sep thing, each service has its own admins
BrainDamage there's file hosting, there's game lobby, etc
BrainDamage it's just a way to split the workload so one doesn't have to maintain everything, or each the service admins have access to everything

Bryan Goldstein @brysgo 10:53
So I'm sure it made sense to set everything up that way, but in a world where your services aren't sharing operating systems the operating system would be much lighter. And sandboxing in userland would make more sense
And another service for the game
But I would have a service for files
They would talk to an authorization service if you need one notion of a user

IRC/Gitter bot @TermuxBot 10:58
BrainDamage or you can simply keep both and the authorization for a program are the AND between a user's and the program itself, for a desktop system just have the default user with full permissions
BrainDamage so you'd be AND'ing with 1

Bryan Goldstein @brysgo 11:02
Right except we should be reducing complexity, it is the only way to make building systems practical as time goes on
An OS should:
1) abstract a complex system below into a simpler abstraction
2) be composable with other operating systems
It shouldn't add unnecessary complexity to managing a system

IRC/Gitter bot @TermuxBot 11:05
BrainDamage I'm not sure if people will agree with 2
