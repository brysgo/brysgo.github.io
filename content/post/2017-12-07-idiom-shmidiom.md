What does it mean to be idiomatic? 

"Of, relating to, or conforming to idiom" - Merriam-Webster

 

So what is an idiom?

"The syntactical, grammatical, or structural form peculiar to a language" - Merriam-Webster

When we talk about idiomatic programming, we are talking about doing things because it is "the way" to do them, or because so-and-so says this is a rule that can’t be broken.

Why is it important to see past these idioms and understand **why** they are "the way?"

Just to be clear, it is not my intent to prove that you shouldn’t follow these
idioms. In fact, I think you should follow them, but remember to "know before
you go." To convince you, I will try and reject the hypothesis that "you should
always follow the best idioms regardless of the situation."

Let me take as my example, the golden rule. For those of you that don’t know,
the golden rule is something us Americans are taught in preschool that usually
is somewhere along the lines of "do unto others as you would have them do unto
you." I think we can all agree that it is a pretty good rule to follow. In
order to reject my hypothesis, I just need to find a situation where this is
not the right thing to do. Does this mean that I am a bad person, or that I
think any less of whomever came up with the golden rule? No.

Now, let's say you have a cabin in the woods. I’m not talking up in
Westchester, I’m talking Canadian wilderness area. Someone comes across your 
property, and they are obviously lost, probably hungry, cold and tired. You are
like **really** into the golden rule, super idiomatic, and a very nice person. You
invite them in, offer them food, share your fire, and even let them use your
radio to call into town. This is a great scenario for both people, new
friendships are made, a life is potentially saved. Now let's make a slight
adjustment.

What if you were a masochist? That is, someone who likes inflicting pain on
themselves. It isn’t all that uncommon. A child goes through repeated,
traumatic, painful experiences, and grows up taking pleasure in the feeling of
pain. Now you are that child all grown up, have that same cabin in the woods,
and are super idiomatic about the golden rule. What do you think you will do
with this visitor?

I'm not going to continue because I think it is safe to say the hypothesis has
been rejected.

So instead of being idiomatic, you can realize that even the most thoughtful
and skilled individual can’t think of every possible situation in which their
words can be applied. It is far better to understand the reasoning behind those
words and use the lessons learned to improve your approach going forward.
