The year is 2003. It is a lovely spring day and I can see out my window where the trees and birds sing. Then a yell comes from downstairs, it is my mother telling me it is so nice out I should come outside. The temptation is strong, but the draw of my new computer that I had been obsessing over is even stronger.

Fast-forward to 2020. COVID-19 terrorizes the world and we are all forced to quarantine until god knows when. That temptation to go outside and play, to socialize and do things in person is gone. Now suddenly that world that I've been so drawn to my entire life is the world everyone else is suddenly living in.

The next few blog posts that I write will be dedicated to diving into how I am staying sane in this time of prolonged physical isolation.
