While we are physically isolated from each-other, we are missing the ability to go out and make new experiences with the people we care about as well as spontaneous experiences with people we've never seen before.

We are all connected with each-other via the internet, but the internet lacks the richness of experiences that you get in the real world. While this is true to some degree, if you dive into the world of video games, you will quickly realize that it can provide some pretty incredible experiences that make you forget you are at home in your apartment.

When I talk about video games, I am talking about a spectrum from apps like Houseparty, where you can choose from three party games to play with friends all the way to fully immersive massively multiplayer online games.

Instead of trying to explain these games for you, I will talk about some of the experiences I've had in them during my quarantine.

<talk about houseparties with trybal people>

<talk about jackbox games with case team>

<talk about video games with max and jordan>

<talk about solo exploration of greece in assasin's creed>

Now I won't lie to you and tell you that adding these experiences to your life will replace the ones you are missing. Last night was the first Passover seder and when it came time for the festive meal, I closed zoom on my laptop and ate my burger lightly salted by the tears flowing off of my cheeks. However, the fact that I was able to turn on a video game after diner and escape into another reality did a lot to get me through it.
