I love open source. I love to imagine writing code a certain way, trying to find something that does it, failing to find said thing and building it. I love publishing it and watching people use it. I don't love maintaining it, I don't love the thought of having to improve it with the responsibility involved with making sure those improvements don't break anything for anyone using your thing in a way you didn't intend it to be used.

I've never been good at building community around my open source and I always wish people would volunteer to take on bug fixes or improvements, but it rarely happens. One of the things I hope to document in this blog is my journey trying to get open source to work for me, and maybe share a little bit of the joy and excitement I get from doing it.
