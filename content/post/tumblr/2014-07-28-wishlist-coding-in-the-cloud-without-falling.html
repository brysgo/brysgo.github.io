<p>As a diehard Google fanboy, it is my duty to figure out how I can switch to a Chromebook as my primary laptop. The only way I can see myself doing that is if I were provided a web based programming experience that was better than coding on metal.</p>
<p>Enter Bryan&rsquo;s fantasy world, where a flourishing space economy affords us with cheap vacations to the moon and once a year visits to grandma on the mars colony. Err&hellip; I mean where there is a really cool way to work on code in the cloud.</p>
<p>I started my version of this in 2012 in meteorjs, I called the project <a href="https://github.com/Socrenchus/Meteorite">meteorite</a> (everyone who knows meteor is laughing at me right now). It was a very primitive project where you start a meteor server and others could load it up and collaborate on changes that synced to your filesystem.</p>
<p>I recently started giving it a once over to see if I could get it up to snuff for my recent ideas on tightening the communication gap in something like a <a href="https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html">git workflow</a>.</p>
<p>As I pulled the open source threads I found many projects from a <a href="https://github.com/mad-eye">github account by the name of mad-eye</a> useful. After I quick search, I realized it was because they were doing exactly what I was trying to do.</p>
<p>I was about to <a href="http://brysgo.tumblr.com/2014/07/27/wishlist-series.html">abandon the idea</a> when I thought about how receptive my company is to <a href="https://schoolkeep.zendesk.com/hc/en-us">feedback and suggestions</a> from customers. So here it is, my first of what will hopefully be many wishlists.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span><strong>Wishlist</strong></span></p>
<ol><li><strong>A single source of truth that my whole team can work on simultaneously</strong></li>
<li><strong>The ability for each team member to live check out a version of the codebase that has either been vetted or written by that member</strong></li>
<li><strong>The ability to live check out a version of the codebase that has been vetted by every member of the team (for production)</strong></li>
<li><strong><span>The ability to accept changes made by team members and see who has accepted which </span>pieces<span> of code</span></strong></li>
</ol></blockquote>
<p><span>This would mean turning most people&rsquo;s git workflows inside out. </span><span>Instead of patches and commits going into a central repository when a consensus is reached on their quality, they make their way from a central source of truth out to each individual&rsquo;s server where they run their own version of the code with code that excludes code they have not yet accepted.</span></p>
<p><span>Not only would this eliminate <a href="http://geekandpoke.typepad.com/geekandpoke/2010/10/being-a-code-made-easy-chapter-1.html">merge conflicts<img alt="image" src="https://31.media.tumblr.com/5cc58bdb127201998116ee18801beef9/tumblr_inline_n9ei7bOPAM1r60sb8.jpg"/></a></span></p>

<p>It would improve communication and make modeling complex problems a much more fluid team experience akin to working on a structure in minecraft.</p>
<p>Since I will probably never get around to doing this on my own, I figured I would share my two cents. Hope it makes your roadmap :-)</p>
