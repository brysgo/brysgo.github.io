<p>Baked Soylent</p>

<p>This is not my first attempt to bake with Soylent. During beta testing I made a few batches of peanut butter cookies.  I made a few mistakes with this batch of brownies but overall the taste and texture are OK. My hubby, who is not a soylent drinker, came home and cut himself a big piece. On first taste he knew these weren’t regular brownies, but that did not stop him from finishing them.  The 2 biggest mistakes I made was pouring the powder into the bowl then adding the wet ingredients. Most baking recipes have you mix the wet ingredients first then adding the dry to the wet. I’m sure this will result in easier mixing and not overworking the batter. The second mistake was covering them before they were completely cooled.  This resulted in the crunchy crust that formed in baking getting soft and the brownies became sticky and difficult to cut. This was easily fixed by simply leaving the cover off overnight. As for the recipe:</p>
<p>Combine:</p>
<p>1 pouch of Soylent</p>
<p>&frac12; cup of cocoa powder</p>
<p>&frac14; teaspoon baking soda</p>
<p>&frac12; cup sugar </p>
<p>Mix together:</p>
<p>1 egg</p>
<p>1/3 cup vegetable oil (=1 bottle of Soylent oil blend)</p>
<p>2/3 cup +1 tablespoon  water</p>
<p>&frac12; teaspoon vanilla</p>
<p>Once the wet ingredients are combined slowly add the dry mix.  I used a whisk but an electric mixer on medium speed would work fine. If it is too dry add additional water at 1 tablespoon at a time but no more than a total of 1 cup of water. </p>
<p>Grease the bottom and sides of a 8” x 12” glass dish.( I used good old Crisco. You could use the spray on products like Pam. <strong><em>Do not use butter)</em></strong> Pour in the mixture. Bake in a preheated oven at 325 degrees for 40-45 minutes. Insert a knife to check for doneness. If it comes out clean you are done. If the batter is still wet bake an additional 5 minutes.  </p>
<p>Please share your experience and feedback on this recipe.  I look at this as the scientific process and experiments should be reproducible by others.</p>
<p>ENJOY! </p>
