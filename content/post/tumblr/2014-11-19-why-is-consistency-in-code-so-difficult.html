<p>
  Why is it we can’t just agree on a pattern to use when programming and get
  everything done already?
</p>
<p>
  The fact is that while language level stylistic differences are very easy to
  agree on, the patterns in which you use the tools provided by the language
  emerge proportional to the size of the system.
</p>
<p>
  So you can come to a new pattern, agree on it, come to the next, agree on it,
  etc… but there will always be more patterns.
</p>
<p>
  Okay well, we can’t agree on patterns, at least we can agree on philosophies
  for coming up with new patterns?<!--more-->
</p>
<p>
  The problem here is like my nuggets of wisdom philosophies for creating new
  patterns conflict with each other and have tradeoffs.
</p>
<p>
  Sometimes you end up writing code to do something your code base already does
  elsewhere in a different way. Because we are giving names to structures we
  can’t see or touch, it can be difficult to be sure code is doing what you
  think.
</p>
<p>
  In contrast, sometimes you have a hammer and everything looks like a nail. You
  use the same pattern to implement something in another place and then realize
  you jammed a square peg in a round hole.
