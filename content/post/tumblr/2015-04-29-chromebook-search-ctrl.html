<p>In order to do development on my Chromebook, I need to change the search key to a control key. Problem is the search key is really sexy, and while I can make the control key the search key, it just isn&rsquo;t the same. Also, sometimes I actually try and use Ctrl like a control key and everything is wonky.</p>

<p>So here is my request. I want to be able to set the search key to bring up the search if I havenâ€™t pressed any keys in combination with it, but if I have, it should act like a control key.</p>

<p>If you work on chrome and get this done, I will be forever grateful!</p>
