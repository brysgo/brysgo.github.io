<a href=//www.brysgo.com/tags/backstory><kbd class=item-tag>backstory</kbd></a></div><div align=start class=content><p>I recently had an epiphany about the mixed image of success that I project and why it is so confusing from an outsider looking in. I&rsquo;m writing this to turn my inner monologue outwards in the off chance that someone else has experienced the same thing, but also to help others understand where I&rsquo;m coming from.</p><p>I haven&rsquo;t had a long history of success with women, but I&rsquo;ve been in enough situations where women were competing for my attention that my standards were unrealistically high, and my game unfortunately low. This was always really puzzling to me and I would enjoy being successful in the situations where I was and not waste time chasing women in situations where I wasn&rsquo;t.</p><p>It wasn&rsquo;t until a bad date recently where I decided to try and understand my mixed bag a little better so that the next girl I date won&rsquo;t be so confident that I&rsquo;m not the right choice.</p><p>I read a book on what women are looking for and it put my experience into perspective for me. As someone who has always walked confidently to the beat of his own drum, I&rsquo;ve been a very confusing input into the formula that women have for judging success.</p><p>The formula I&rsquo;ve always followed has been to maximize my ability to change the world in service of the exciting science fiction future I always dreamed of. Sure, there are other things along the way that factored into the equation, but everything felt like a tool on the way to this goal.</p><p>I have a very large family that I value intrinsically, but has proved essential at keeping me grounded to reality while I take off in persuit of the impossible, but my inability to find friends who understand me served to limit my social reach. For this reason, family earned a pretty high priority in my formula.</p><p>Work, also earned a high priority. As a driven, highly practiced, no bullshit personality, I excelled quite quickly through the early stages of my career. It is for this same reason, that I started to get women&rsquo;s attention. What I didn&rsquo;t realize, is that women don&rsquo;t care about my craft, they care about my ability to command respect from and lead a group of intelligent people.</p><p>It turns out that the way I choose to behave, and the way women judge attractiveness, only lined up some of the time. For instance, if I perceived a situation demanded action in service of my goals, I would take action. If that action was to change the minds of a large group of people, or start a new trend, it was perceived as attractive. Or, a more frequent one at work, if I worked solo on a project and gave it a significant boost, people would talk about it, and those whispers would get places before I did.</p><p>Now there have been instances where I was attractive to women outside of work, but it has always been when my perceived competence has shown. The ability to manage a relationship well, the ability to take care of children, the ability to steer a group, the ability to program, cook, ski, climb, play piano&mldr; demonstrating these things made me attractive to women but it didn&rsquo;t give me a strong social fabric.</p><p>Because of this, my perceived success on a date, especially in quarantine, is quite low. This is compounded by a combination of how reluctant I am to sell myself and the impossible standard with which I judge myself. In my mind, if I&rsquo;m not on track to achieve my dreams, I&rsquo;m a failure, even if I have all the things other people dream of.</p><p>It wasn&rsquo;t until my mid twenties that I realized having a strong social fabric at work was very nice and generally made things better, but since all my sports are solo sports, I didn&rsquo;t spend much time building social capital outside work. Because I have a tendency to feel like people don&rsquo;t understand me, it hasn&rsquo;t really been a priority for me. My recent experience at work pushing past a plateau I&rsquo;ve been stuck on, along with a gentile reminder by this book I just read, have pushed me to start getting serious about my social life.</p><p>This isn&rsquo;t about succeeding or becoming better, but simply maintaining a healthy emotional state and keeping the emotional state of everyone around you healthy. Adjusting my priority on this alone is the difference between the place in my life where I&rsquo;ve been stuck, and the place I need to get to.</p><p>As an aside, It is important to me that people get something from my blogs, so I&rsquo;ve been writing a bit less. The problem is I&rsquo;m not assessing the emotional value of my blogs, only the logical value. I hope reading about someone else&rsquo;s struggle to become better helps you, and it would help me to hear that also.</p></div><h4 class=page-header>Related</h4><div class=item><h4><a href=/post/2020-10-08-What-is-life-7c954f/>What is life?</a></h4><h5>October 8, 2020</h5><a href=//www.brysgo.com/tags/life><kbd class=item-tag>life</kbd></a>
