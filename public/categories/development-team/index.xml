      <description>Too many massive pull requests are a smell, but sometimes big pull requests are a necessity. It is easy to come across a large pull request and immediately reject it, but you shouldnâ€™t be intimidated by the size of a PR.
Your first job when reviewing such a PR is to identify why it is so large. Is there a large piece of functionality being added or Is a common pattern in the code being changed?</description>
