      <description>As a New Yorker, I often feel guilty for how filthy it is and how there are people who have to live on our filthy streets.
I try to give (not on the street) like a good person, but I always feel like it isn’t enough. So I did what I do everyday and attempted to solve my problems with emotionless calculations.
I’m not super religious, but the first place I look when I’m in a moral dilemma is to my religion.</description>
