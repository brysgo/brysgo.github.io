      <description>I was about to leave a scathing review of the CVS on east 72nd and 2nd, including the manager, Marc, when I read a little bit about how CVS treats it’s employees like crap and I decided against it.
The only thing that keeps me coming back to the place is that I have a really nice pharmacist named Bobby. I wish I could take him with me when I go somewhere else, but I know I can’t.</description>
