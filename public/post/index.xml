      <title>Crystallize your abstractions carefully...</title>

      <description>For as long as I&amp;rsquo;ve been a developer I have been reminded of the rule of three for refactoring and every time I hear it, I die a little inside.
If building a new abstraction is so painful, that it is easier to copy and paste large chunks of code, you need to rethink the way you are building your abstractions. Building the right abstractions isn&amp;rsquo;t just a time consuming distraction from building software, it is software engineering.</description>

      <title>Imaginary Lines</title>

      <description>If I had to sum up the job of a software engineer in laymen&amp;rsquo;s terms, I would tell you that we draw imaginary lines around imaginary concepts until those concepts can map to both a specific set of instructions for a machine and a common understanding for programmers.
Why am I stating the obvious? Well, it is quite simply to emphasize just how important it is where we draw those lines.</description>

      <description> I&amp;rsquo;m sure most of you, if you have done any work with graphql, have heard of graphiql. It is an indespensible tool for writing and testing graphql queries.
The problem is that now that I&amp;rsquo;m not using express at the moment. I don&amp;rsquo;t want to go through the trouble of trying to fit graphiql into my stack.
To solve it, a graphiql bookmarklet:  Enjoy! </description>

      <description>If you haven&amp;rsquo;t yet read about jscodemigrate, read about it here. If you already know about jscodemigrate then stick around because there is a new feature, and it is ready for you to use, just npm install jscodemigrate@latest --save-dev.
You already know that you can run all of your jscodeshift scripts at once and easily maintain your project with a directory full of timestamped codemods, but now, you can make it easy for those who depend on your npm packages to respond quickly to your API changes.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve worked on lots of projects big and small, but as time went on they all suffered from the same problem. Changing standards and updated api&amp;rsquo;s left code fragmented as the codebase grew.
From the time I started working on coffeelint, the problem has been stewing in my head. Subconciously on the lookout for a solution, I heard about codemods. Let me preface by saying I&amp;rsquo;ve been quite obsessed with everything facebook engineering has been doing in open source lately.</description>

      <description>I recently switched over the project I was working on from MongoDB to PostgreSQL. The reason for the switch is not what I&amp;rsquo;m writing to discuss, but I&amp;rsquo;ll just say that the unpredictability of mongodb was starting to become an issue in development. The thought was that if it was already difficult before the data starts pouring in, it will probably be a nightmare one the product is in use. And that meant switching from graffiti-mongoose, to my own graphql database glue.</description>

      <title>React Native on Heroku</title>

      <description>As a web developer doing iOS development with react native, I need a staging environment for the product manager to review changes to the app.
On the web, that means using Heroku, but with a react native app it is a bit more complicated.
My react native app has two components, the packager (for serving the client code) and the server (for interacting with the app).
Heroku only lets one process bind to an external port, so it wasn&amp;rsquo;t easy to do without creating two heroku apps.</description>

      <title>Will Relay replace Flux?</title>
      <link>http://brysgo.com/2015/07/25/relay-vs-flux/</link>

      <guid>http://brysgo.com/2015/07/25/relay-vs-flux/</guid>
      <description>Relay is out in preview! Have a look.
 When people talk about Relay they think of it as the server-client link in the Facebook stack, but is that really all it is?
Flux still has a place on the client because you need to manage temporary app state, right?
I think it doesn&amp;rsquo;t. Flux is an architecture for unidirectional data flow that separates out input from the user and the server so that it can react without getting tangled up.</description>

      <title>Why I&#39;m Excited for Facebook&#39;s Relay and GraphQL</title>

      <description>Relay is out in preview! Have a look.
 I want to tell you in as few words as possible why I am so excited to get my hands on Relay and GraphQL.
React is widely popular because it is simple and declarative, making it very deterministic and easy to work with. React is also fully composable, making it imensly powerful with high potential for writing reusable code.</description>

      <title>Bringing back &#39;Under Construction&#39; in style</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m just going to go ahead and say what&amp;rsquo;s on everyone&amp;rsquo;s mind already. Where did all those great under construction pages from the 90s go with the animated gifs and text scrolling accross the screen.
Since I know you all missed those pages so much, I brought them back. If you visit any of my websites that I have yet to utilize:
 worthy.gift unravel.space solve.technology socrenchus.com stackoverachieve.com stackoverachiever.com  You will see an under construction banner that uses HTML5 gradients, text shadow, and of course, a marquee tag.</description>

      <title>Searching for an Isomorphic Reactiflux Stack</title>
      <link>http://brysgo.com/2015/06/17/isomorphic-react-flux-stack/</link>

      <guid>http://brysgo.com/2015/06/17/isomorphic-react-flux-stack/</guid>
      <description>Now that Relay is out in preview, it will probably replace Flux entirely.
 Why React? A few months ago, the release of React Native by Facebook convinced me to make the leap to React.
I spent a while working on a React Native app and quickly learned that I needed to bring in Flux. After watching a few videos and reading a few blogs, I added my own implementation of flux to my react native app.</description>

      <description>Now I know this isn&amp;rsquo;t my first time promising more blog time but I&amp;rsquo;m renewing my vows.
I&amp;rsquo;m not going to be so rigid with my every day blog promise, but I will make an effort where possible. Also, I plan on doing something which I haven&amp;rsquo;t done before which is try to keep my blog posts up to date.
If you go back through my blog posts you will see edits and updates to make sure I can stay proud of my blog instead of being unconfident of stale blog posts.</description>

      <description>Just switched my blog to Jekyll because it is easier to manage. I will probably continue using tumblr here and there to reblog interesting things, but not to write my posts.
Also didn&amp;rsquo;t feel like deleting the intro post, so here it is&amp;hellip;
 You’ll find this post in your _posts directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run jekyll serve, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.</description>

      <title>Minimalist? or just boring?</title>

      <description>EDIT: Blog is now on Jekyll and has replaced main website, katamari is playable on any blog page so no fake text is needed. I consider myself a pretty minimalist individual. I follow the time tested principles of YAGNI and build my systems in small, single purpose components.
I’ve had a very simple website for quite some time now. All it has is my name and a list of social media / web profile links.</description>

      <description>This is a blog post to advocate for something that is generally frowned upon in software development. If you want to join the angry crowd and throw rotten tomatoes, you are welcome to.
  Now I’ve never had trouble finding jobs in the past when I was looking for full time work, but recently I’ve had a change of heart. I decided that in order to avoid getting stuck on one problem, one team, one process and building stress over the imperfection that lies in between, I would keep myself occupied with more than one project.</description>

      <title>Wishlist: Chromebook search/ctrl</title>

      <guid>http://brysgo.com/2015/04/29/chromebook-search-ctrl/</guid>
      <description>In order to do development on my Chromebook, I need to change the search key to a control key. Problem is the search key is really sexy, and while I can make the control key the search key, it just isn&amp;rsquo;t the same. Also, sometimes I actually try and use Ctrl like a control key and everything is wonky.
So here is my request. I want to be able to set the search key to bring up the search if I haven’t pressed any keys in combination with it, but if I have, it should act like a control key.</description>

      <description>I just got a Chromebook pixel today and it is gorgeous. It embodies simplicity and minimalism while still being completely functional.
  Unboxing it was a great experience. When you take it out and open it up for the first time, it turns on in an instant and it is ready for you to pick a WiFi connection and log in.
I can’t remember using a computer so responsive to my input, it feels really fast.</description>

      <description>I recently did something a little crazy. I am a professional web developer, and I decided I was going to move all of my development to the cloud. This paradigm that has brought so much convenience into every corner of my life was going to close the final gap. It took me a little while, but I have 99% percent of what I had going on my Macbook Pro, so here is my setup.</description>

      <description>As a New Yorker, I often feel guilty for how filthy it is and how there are people who have to live on our filthy streets.
I try to give (not on the street) like a good person, but I always feel like it isn’t enough. So I did what I do everyday and attempted to solve my problems with emotionless calculations.
I’m not super religious, but the first place I look when I’m in a moral dilemma is to my religion.</description>

 January 8, 2015
Happy new year! Volatility is alive and well!
Let’s recap the first five days: the S&amp;amp;P 500 Index sold off 2.7% for the first three days and then surged 3.0% for the next two days.
The sharp stock market volatility has proved especially challenging for all but the nimblest&amp;hellip;
 Thanks for the advice, seems like a fairly low risk / low maintenance way to maintain a portfolio.</description>

 Here is a quick synopsis of my case&amp;hellip;
 I was diagnosed with Crohn&amp;rsquo;s disease when I was 7 years old. I have managed to avoid surgery, but was a frequent flyer in the emergency room for flare ups.</description>

Do you use Capybara-Webkit to run your feature tests?
Now you can run your teaspoon suite faster without having to install and boot up phantomjs. Just use the new Capybara-Webkit driver for teaspoon! You may also have more success with it on your CI server, as that is what caused us to make this change.</description>

      <description>The problem: You finish writing your test in rspec, and after you have carefully described the scenario, you go to write your next test. For your next test you need to check that after you do everything for the first test, the next thing doesn’t break.
Potential hacks:
a) Well, it is just this one time, I can ignore the description of the spec and just throw in another assertion after my test.</description>

      <description>Google calendar has many features I rely on, one of my favorites is the integration with Google now that helps you get where you need to go on time.
I use the to make sure I always leave time for the subway. However, sometimes my trips are a little longer. Google already knows when I&amp;rsquo;m going on a flight, why not add trips to my calendar.
If I&amp;rsquo;m going on a train to long island two hours of my time are spent on the train.</description>

      <description>Why do we use domain specific languages? My first reaction to them when I started programming in the real world was to scorn them with the attitude that they introduce unnecessary complication for both the developer and the computer. What good could they possibly do?
Like any programmer thrown into a stack, I faithfully used the established patterns, knowing that any divergence from the standard usually has a much worse effect than dealing with it.</description>

      <description>If you are writing an API sandbox with a local development tool, you will no doubt need fixtures for your API’s modeling.
It turns out those fixtures are a great example of how your API is modeled. If you comment on those fixtures, they can be great documentation for the perusing developer.
I spent some time trying to automatically generate HTML documentation from YAML with inline comments. I got as far as generating a nice set of nested tables.</description>

      <description>What do you get when you cross meteorjs with rails?
The answer is quite simply, voltrb.
Getting started is not quite as easy as meteor or rails, which isn’t surprising considering how fresh it is.
So far I built a search box that creates new items on submit, but searches through existing items as you type. I’m building the site that will go here: http://www.procedur.al.
I love how you get default models and collections for each storage method and you can optionally create models that are autoloaded if they exist.</description>

      <description>…umm, I mean let’s all use the same service so we don’t have to manage or own hardware.
There are advantages and disadvantages to distributing the internet. One of the advantages initially were that it was the only way to host anything. There were no easy services for sharing content.
There are of course many other advantages to the distribution of the internet, like fault tolerance, but those were quickly forgotten.</description>

      <description>Software engineers are responsible for adding new and unforeseen complexity to established, carefully thought out systems.
It tends to be a reflex when told to add complexity, that we special case the complexity and fall through to the system you had before. This works in many cases and is great if the complexity being added is a footnote that you don&amp;rsquo;t intend to come back to.
 Complexity that is essential to the long term success of your product needs to be &amp;ldquo;native.</description>

      <title>Strategies for reviewing massive pull requests</title>

      <description>Too many massive pull requests are a smell, but sometimes big pull requests are a necessity. It is easy to come across a large pull request and immediately reject it, but you shouldn’t be intimidated by the size of a PR.
Your first job when reviewing such a PR is to identify why it is so large. Is there a large piece of functionality being added or Is a common pattern in the code being changed?</description>

      <description>Why is it we can’t just agree on a pattern to use when programming and get everything done already?
The fact is that while language level stylistic differences are very easy to agree on, the patterns in which you use the tools provided by the language emerge proportional to the size of the system.
So you can come to a new pattern, agree on it, come to the next, agree on it, etc… but there will always be more patterns.</description>

      <description>There are only two hard things in Computer Science: cache invalidation and naming things.
— Phil Karlton
 Lets hold on to cache invalidation for another post…
Naming things (or should I say labeling them…) is a very hard problem.
Why is it a hard problem? Consider this, imagine you are building a piece of IKEA furniture. You get all the pieces in the box and you have to put them together.</description>

      <description>Have you ever played a videogame where you sit down, turn on the game, and are overwhelmed with a thousand cool things you can do?
NO
Why not? Because that game company went out of business long ago. Games start with one thing the user can do, waits until the user is comfortable, then introduces the next thing.
This makes complete sense. Why would I need to plan a tactical assault in a videogame before I know how to fire my gun?</description>

      <description>I’ve decided to write a blog post every day, even if it is crappy. Why? Is it so I can feel important? Maybe, but I would never admit that. The reason I’m sticking to is that I want to get better at reflecting on important parts of my day.
It may help me appreciate all the interesting things I come across daily that are quickly relegated to a distant memory. Especially the seemingly mundane things I tend to take for granted.</description>

      <description>Today I had another terrifying, tear swallowing pull request moment. It involved clearly abstracted pieces of our system being clearly and purposefully coupled. If this doesn&amp;rsquo;t bring you to your knees let me try and illustrate why this is so bad.
You are the kind of developer that pardon my french, &amp;ldquo;gets shit done.&amp;rdquo; Because you are such a doer, you connect the first input with the desired output. You repeat this with a different input and output a few times.</description>

      <description>First, before you go any further&amp;hellip; check to make sure the image you&amp;rsquo;re trying isn&amp;rsquo;t just broken.
I visited the image in the browser and realized that the browser supported the format, so the broken preview had to be somewhere in filepicker.
In my case I was using a(n) .ico file and since filepicker.io only supports post processing on .jpg and .png I had to come up with a work around.</description>

      <description>As a diehard Google fanboy, it is my duty to figure out how I can switch to a Chromebook as my primary laptop. The only way I can see myself doing that is if I were provided a web based programming experience that was better than coding on metal.

      <description>Those of you who know me already know I am a man of many wishes and dreams. That means as a developer, I dream up, try to start, and abandon many&amp;hellip;many projects.
When I work occasionally to get these projects out of my head and into code, I will pull on any open source threads I am given. The really cool part about this is I usually end up finding the people who are already trying to do what I am setting out to do.</description>

      <description>I was about to leave a scathing review of the CVS on east 72nd and 2nd, including the manager, Marc, when I read a little bit about how CVS treats it’s employees like crap and I decided against it.
The only thing that keeps me coming back to the place is that I have a really nice pharmacist named Bobby. I wish I could take him with me when I go somewhere else, but I know I can’t.</description>

      <description>For a while now I have been curious about Go. There doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem to be much to it, but it is getting more and more popular. Another itch I&amp;rsquo;ve had for a really long time is to write my own machine learning/AI framework. After looking at Golang a bit more, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t shake the feeling that it would be the perfect language for my machine learning framework.
I did some searching and while there were people talking about writing machine learning frameworks in Go, no one was actually doing it.</description>

      <description>I am on the lowest tier of TWC broadband in NYC and I feel like I&amp;rsquo;m connecting from a third world country. For $20 a month I don&amp;rsquo;t expect the fastest internet, but I expect it to be just as reliable as the next persons internet. One thing I&amp;rsquo;m not going to do is pay more to the same people who can&amp;rsquo;t provide decent service in the first place.
Net neutrality is something that has become a hot button issue these days and I&amp;rsquo;m not looking forward to the day when my ISP can tell me what websites I have access to.</description>

      <description>The primary definition of a zombie, according to Google is as follows:
 a corpse said to be revived by witchcraft, esp. in certain African and Caribbean religions.
 Early religions lacked the scientific methods to explain everyday events and defaulted to labeling things that couldn&amp;rsquo;t otherwise be explained as witchcraft.
It is through that stretch of the definition of a zombie that allow the walkers on AMC&amp;rsquo;s The Walking Dead to be labeled zombies.</description>
