      <description>Those of you who know me already know I am a man of many wishes and dreams. That means as a developer, I dream up, try to start, and abandon many&amp;hellip;many projects.
When I work occasionally to get these projects out of my head and into code, I will pull on any open source threads I am given. The really cool part about this is I usually end up finding the people who are already trying to do what I am setting out to do.</description>
