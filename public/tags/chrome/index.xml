      <description>In order to do development on my Chromebook, I need to change the search key to a control key. Problem is the search key is really sexy, and while I can make the control key the search key, it just isn&amp;rsquo;t the same. Also, sometimes I actually try and use Ctrl like a control key and everything is wonky.
So here is my request. I want to be able to set the search key to bring up the search if I haven’t pressed any keys in combination with it, but if I have, it should act like a control key.</description>

      <description>I just got a Chromebook pixel today and it is gorgeous. It embodies simplicity and minimalism while still being completely functional.
  Unboxing it was a great experience. When you take it out and open it up for the first time, it turns on in an instant and it is ready for you to pick a WiFi connection and log in.
I can’t remember using a computer so responsive to my input, it feels really fast.</description>
