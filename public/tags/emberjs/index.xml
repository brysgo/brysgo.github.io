      <description>If I had to sum up the job of a software engineer in laymen&amp;rsquo;s terms, I would tell you that we draw imaginary lines around imaginary concepts until those concepts can map to both a specific set of instructions for a machine and a common understanding for programmers.
Why am I stating the obvious? Well, it is quite simply to emphasize just how important it is where we draw those lines.</description>
