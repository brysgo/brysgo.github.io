      <description>Have you ever played a videogame where you sit down, turn on the game, and are overwhelmed with a thousand cool things you can do?
NO
Why not? Because that game company went out of business long ago. Games start with one thing the user can do, waits until the user is comfortable, then introduces the next thing.
This makes complete sense. Why would I need to plan a tactical assault in a videogame before I know how to fire my gun?</description>
