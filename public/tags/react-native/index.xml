      <title>React Native on Heroku</title>

      <description>As a web developer doing iOS development with react native, I need a staging environment for the product manager to review changes to the app.
On the web, that means using Heroku, but with a react native app it is a bit more complicated.
My react native app has two components, the packager (for serving the client code) and the server (for interacting with the app).
Heroku only lets one process bind to an external port, so it wasn&amp;rsquo;t easy to do without creating two heroku apps.</description>

      <description>I just got a Chromebook pixel today and it is gorgeous. It embodies simplicity and minimalism while still being completely functional.
  Unboxing it was a great experience. When you take it out and open it up for the first time, it turns on in an instant and it is ready for you to pick a WiFi connection and log in.
I canâ€™t remember using a computer so responsive to my input, it feels really fast.</description>
