      <description>The problem: You finish writing your test in rspec, and after you have carefully described the scenario, you go to write your next test. For your next test you need to check that after you do everything for the first test, the next thing doesn’t break.
Potential hacks:
a) Well, it is just this one time, I can ignore the description of the spec and just throw in another assertion after my test.</description>

      <description>Why do we use domain specific languages? My first reaction to them when I started programming in the real world was to scorn them with the attitude that they introduce unnecessary complication for both the developer and the computer. What good could they possibly do?
Like any programmer thrown into a stack, I faithfully used the established patterns, knowing that any divergence from the standard usually has a much worse effect than dealing with it.</description>

      <description>If you are writing an API sandbox with a local development tool, you will no doubt need fixtures for your API’s modeling.
It turns out those fixtures are a great example of how your API is modeled. If you comment on those fixtures, they can be great documentation for the perusing developer.
I spent some time trying to automatically generate HTML documentation from YAML with inline comments. I got as far as generating a nice set of nested tables.</description>
