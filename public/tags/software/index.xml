      <description>For as long as I&amp;rsquo;ve been a developer I have been reminded of the rule of three for refactoring and every time I hear it, I die a little inside.
If building a new abstraction is so painful, that it is easier to copy and paste large chunks of code, you need to rethink the way you are building your abstractions. Building the right abstractions isn&amp;rsquo;t just a time consuming distraction from building software, it is software engineering.</description>

      <description>Software engineers are responsible for adding new and unforeseen complexity to established, carefully thought out systems.
It tends to be a reflex when told to add complexity, that we special case the complexity and fall through to the system you had before. This works in many cases and is great if the complexity being added is a footnote that you don&amp;rsquo;t intend to come back to.
 Complexity that is essential to the long term success of your product needs to be &amp;ldquo;native.</description>
