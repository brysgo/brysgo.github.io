So why am I so excited for the end of work?
The reason is that while I do believe the future will be that way for some, I think the vast majority will have a much different experience.</description></item><item><title>My AI Story (3/3)</title><link>//www.brysgo.com/post/2020-07-26-My-AI-Story-33-11a67c/</link><pubDate>Sun, 26 Jul 2020 17:04:03 +0000</pubDate><guid>//www.brysgo.com/post/2020-07-26-My-AI-Story-33-11a67c/</guid><description>After graduating with my BS in Computer Science, AI moved to side project status as I took a job as a Full Stack Software Engineer at Pivotal Labs. The side project years of my AI life made slow progress. I managed to play with some algorithms that one time when I was trying to learn golang. I eventually implemented my logic gate pool genetic algorithm as part of a more ambitions side project I called thoughtnet.</description></item><item><title>My AI Story (2/3)</title><link>//www.brysgo.com/post/2020-07-21-My-AI-Story-23-e5cf6d/</link><pubDate>Tue, 21 Jul 2020 17:03:40 +0000</pubDate><guid>//www.brysgo.com/post/2020-07-21-My-AI-Story-23-e5cf6d/</guid><description>Learning in school was very difficult for me because I was more of a hands on learner and school was very heavy on lecturing. When I am in situations that frustrate me, I try and solve them with technology. This was what I had planned to do with my ed tech company &amp;ldquo;Socrenchus.&amp;rdquo; Before Socrenchus though, I was interning in Mountain View and I got to meet some of the AI great&amp;rsquo;s.</description></item><item><title>My AI Story (1/3)</title><link>//www.brysgo.com/post/2020-07-16-My-AI-Story-13-e86392/</link><pubDate>Thu, 16 Jul 2020 17:03:56 +0000</pubDate><guid>//www.brysgo.com/post/2020-07-16-My-AI-Story-13-e86392/</guid><description>If I&amp;rsquo;m going to start writing about AI, I figure I should give some backstory first on my life in AI.
My first introduction to AI was probably when I was 9 years old and snuck downstairs to watch the first Matrix movie that I wasn&amp;rsquo;t supposed to be watching. This did a great deal to feed what has become an AI obsession over the years.
In high school, after I had been programming on my own for a while with only stack overflow to guide me (plus a couple people who volunteered to help me with my shareware), I started pondering about AI from the perspective of how it worked.</description></item><item><title>New Landing Page - New Commitment</title><link>//www.brysgo.com/post/2020-07-11-new-landing-page/</link><pubDate>Sat, 11 Jul 2020 07:36:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>//www.brysgo.com/post/2020-07-11-new-landing-page/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to redo my landing page in response to a realization that I need to sell myself a bit better.

There doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem to be much to it, but it is getting more and more popular. Another itch I&amp;rsquo;ve had for a really long time is to write my own machine learning/AI framework. After looking at Golang a bit more, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t shake the feeling that it would be the perfect language for my machine learning framework. I did some searching and while there were people talking about writing machine learning frameworks in Go, no one was actually doing it.</description></item></channel></rss>
