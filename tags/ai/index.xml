My first introduction to AI was probably when I was 9 years old and snuck downstairs to watch the first Matrix movie that I wasn&amp;rsquo;t supposed to be watching. This did a great deal to feed what has become an AI obsession over the years.
In high school, after I had been programming on my own for a while with only stack overflow to guide me (plus a couple people who volunteered to help me with my shareware), I started pondering about AI from the perspective of how it worked.</description></item><item><title>New Landing Page - New Commitment</title><link>//brysgo.com/post/2020-07-11-new-landing-page/</link><pubDate>Sat, 11 Jul 2020 07:36:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>//brysgo.com/post/2020-07-11-new-landing-page/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to redo my landing page in response to a realization that I need to sell myself a bit better.

There doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem to be much to it, but it is getting more and more popular. Another itch I&amp;rsquo;ve had for a really long time is to write my own machine learning/AI framework. After looking at Golang a bit more, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t shake the feeling that it would be the perfect language for my machine learning framework. I did some searching and while there were people talking about writing machine learning frameworks in Go, no one was actually doing it.</description></item></channel></rss>
