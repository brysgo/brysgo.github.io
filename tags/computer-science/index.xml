&lt;p>There are only two hard things in Computer Science: cache invalidation and naming things.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>— Phil Karlton&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Lets hold on to cache invalidation for another post&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-4-gLlF0uw">…&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Naming things (or should I say labeling them&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-4-gLlF0uw">…&lt;/a>) is a very hard problem.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2>Why is it a hard problem?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Consider this, imagine you are building a piece of IKEA furniture. You get all the pieces in the box and you have to put them together. Now imagine that all the pieces had a succinct description that you used to put them together. Now imagine that you couldn’t see or feel the pieces and all you had to work with were these descriptions.&lt;/p>
