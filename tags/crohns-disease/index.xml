&lt;p>&lt;strong>UPDATE:&lt;/strong> The nutritionist suggested I stop soylent after version 1.4 made me irregular and wasn't helping me keep on weight. 1.5 looks better but I am going to wait a little before diving back in.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Here is a quick synopsis of my case&amp;hellip;&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;em>I was diagnosed with Crohn&amp;rsquo;s disease when I was 7 years old. I have managed to avoid surgery, but was a frequent flyer in the emergency room for flare ups. I was on remicade for about ten years and have been on mercaptopurine and mesalamine since I was diagnosed. I was on antibiotics from the time I was diagnosed until I graduated college, and somewhere in that span I was briefly on growth hormones and steroids. Additionally, I am most recently back on antibiotics and budesonide.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>My most recent flare up a few months ago is what put me on budesonide and a few weeks before I started soylent I went back on antibiotics (tinidazole and ciprofloxacin). I ordered soylent months ago and was delighted when Soylent V1.3 arrived in the midst of me trying to control my symptoms.</description></item></channel></rss>
