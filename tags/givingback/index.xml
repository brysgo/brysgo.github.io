&lt;p>&lt;span>As a New Yorker, I often feel guilty for how filthy it is and how there are people who have to live on our filthy streets.&lt;/span>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;span>I try to give (not on the street) like a good person, but I always feel like it isn’t enough. So I did what I do everyday and attempted to solve my problems with emotionless calculations.&lt;/span>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;span>I’m not super religious, but the first place I look when I’m in a moral dilemma is to my religion. I vaguely remember from pre-school that one of the commandments (the extended version) instructs us to leave the corners of our fields.&lt;/span>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;span>Here comes the math. The area of a circle, the shape used to plow a field, is πr^&lt;/span>&lt;span>2&lt;/span>&lt;span> and the formula for a square (the presumed average shape of a field) is x^&lt;/span>&lt;span>2&lt;/span>&lt;span>.&lt;/span>&lt;/p>
