There doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem to be much to it, but it is getting more and more popular. Another itch I&amp;rsquo;ve had for a really long time is to write my own machine learning/AI framework.

I did some searching and while there were people talking about writing machine learning frameworks in Go, no one was actually doing it.</description></item></channel></rss>
