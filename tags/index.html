refresh-summary-title">High Altitude Mass Volley</h3><p class=refresh-summary>Preamble I have always been interested in space, but this idea for getting there cheaper has been brewing for a few years, and while I’ve yet to sit down and do the math, it has gotten to a place where it seems intuitive enough to work.
Before I go into the solution, let’s look at the problem. At present, out best way of getting to space involves stacking explosives as high as we can, sitting on top with a countdown, and hoping that we planned for all the eventualities.
Setting aside the risk to life and property involved in this, we have the issue of more weight requiring more fuel, which is in turn, more weight. This makes it so launching payloads doesn’t scale linearly.
Inspirational work This all started with a jump back in time to Newton’s cannonball. It certainly would solve for having to carry that pesky fuel? The problem with this, is that if you want to reach orbital velocity, not even accounting for air resistance, the acceleration required would be more than enough to kill you.
But we are determined to get to space! Violent acceleration can’t stop us. What about a train? Those accelerate slowly and get going really fast. This is actually a great idea. You would need a massively long train, but something like Elon Musk’s hyperloop might do. Aside from the capital costs of this approach, we have to deal with air resistance when we exit the hyperloop. This could potentially be solved by building a hyperloop muzzle that ascends into the sky to where the air is thin. I am a huge fan of this idea and it would drastically lower the cost of sending things to space if we are able to invest enough upfront to make it happen. But is there a way we can do something at lower cost now? Can we overcome the challenge of acceleration, fuel weight, and air resistance without being united in the effort by another cold war?
Back to the basics If we think back to the cannon, it works, we can accelerate small pellets past escape velocity with current technology and we have very sophisticated targeting software that could hit a target from very far away. What if we just had a lot of very small guns shooting a space ship to propel it to orbit?
There are more than a couple problems with this, including:
air resistance turbulence complicating targeting obstructions blocking the craft wear on the craft from impact collecting projectiles But if done right, this approach could be very desirable. It could allow our payload to have almost no sophistication, which would make reusability much easier. It also could tie into an electrical grid, which would make it cheap.
Wear on the craft is the easiest to solve. We can use electromagnetic projectiles, or even just make the projectiles very soft and light.
Second easiest to solve for is collection. With a little bit of sophistication on our craft, we can collect the pellets and fire them back at collectors, or without sophistication, we can place collectors where the mass will fall.
Finally, air resistance, turbulence and other atmospheric obstructions are where we really start to scratch our heads. Could these be show stoppers?
Proposal What if we put these little projectile accelerators at the top of the atmosphere? How would we do that? Balloons. If we launched a network of balloons that functioned to fire tiny projectiles rapidly at high velocities, we get a new set of problems, but not ones that can’t be solved.
New problems:
Power Getting payload to upper atmosphere Collecting projectiles (harder) Maintaining balloon fleet Since we are no longer in the ground, we can’t tap into the grid directly, but we can use a combination of solar and microwave charging.
It is harder to fly a payload to high altitude than it is to go from the ground, but airplanes do a pretty good job of that.
The last two are the harder ones, but not unsolvable. For collecting pellets, the payload would have to be equipped with something to catch the pellets and fire them back. Ideally with some kind of targeting pellet spray nozzle with the ability to spread the pellets accross many collectors. The balloons would need to redistribute the pellets amongst themselves. This could be through phisical links between balloons or by relaying shots between balloons. While this is hard, it is not impossible. One way the collection problem could be circumvented, is by making dry ice and not worrying about collection. Would cost a bit more energy, but may be a good fallback.
Finally, we have to maintain a fleet of balloons. Helium is expensive and we would need to make sure each balloon has power, pellets, helium, and a functional microcontroller. While this is daunting, companies have attempted to maintain fleets of balloons in the past, so again, should be doable.
Now I won’t pretend my proposed solution is perfectly safe, or that payloads scale in a perfectly linear fashion, but it seems to make significant leaps in solving both of these issues as well as many others, including reusability.
Future work Seeing as this is the culmination of lots of shower thoughts, and that I’ve never worked in the aerospace industry, there is still lots of work to be done pressure testing the idea.
Parameter setting — set the mass and velocity of the projectiles, determine number of balloons and surface are of balloon network Prove energy transfer to balloons — microwave, solar, etc Network balloons through hardware and/or software — can you share resources between them, stabilize each other Prove that electromagnetic gun can rapid fire light projectiles to satisfy parameters Prove that projectile collection or in air manufacturing is possible I hope that I get a chance to take some of these on in the future. But I’m also interested to hear what other people’s thoughts are. Has anyone explored something similar? Are there obvious things that I missed?</p><div class="action has-text-right"><a href=/post/2019-08-07-high-altitude-mass-volley/ class="button is-primary">Read more</a></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></section><section class=section><div class=container><div class=columns><div class="column is-centered-tablet-portrait"><h1 class="title section-title">abstraction</h1><h5 class="subtitle is-5 is-muted"></h5><div class=divider></div><div class=section><div class=container><div class=columns></div><div class=columns><div class="column is-4"><div class=box><figure class="image is-3by2"><a href=/post/2017-11-06-job-of-os/><img src=/images/default_summary_hu2be732aee21a2469ead3fe1f2df8caca_2088687_600x0_resize_q75_box.jpg alt></a></figure><h3 class="title is-5 refresh-summary-title">The Job of an OS</h3><p class=refresh-summary>It started with a gitter chat then a tweet, followed by a blog post.
&amp;hellip;
Well, I've had some time to digest my thoughts, and I think it is time for, a second blog post.
Whenever I think something needs redefining, the first thing I like to do is look for a definition (shocking right?). The Merriam-Webster dictionary defines and Operating System as:
Software that controls the operation of a computer and directs the processing of programs (as by assigning storage space in memory and controlling input and output functions)
The problem with this definition is that it is too anchored in the challenges of early computing that involved managing the hardware nuances of different machines and creating a predictable environment in which to work at a higher level.
Fast forward a few decades, and we are living in a world where the challenges of computing, solved each in a separate way, are taming the unique complexities of different devices for the purpose of operating different classes of predictable environments for different types of users.
We spread the gospel of Linux, because it has done so much to advance the state of operating systems and put everyone on the same page when it comes to bringing systems from a hardware level, into the world of software. But companies like Apple, Google, and Samsung build different layers of systems on top of unix/linux. Are these systems not also &amp;ldquo;operating systems?&amp;rdquo; Does a system really have to be dealing in bits to be called an operating system?
If you really do need to be managing a physical computer to be an operating, what does an OS become when it is on a virtual machine? It clearly has a purpose since we use virtual machines all the time, but it isn't an operating system by our old definition, it is in fact, a brilliant hack.
Here is an even more controversial one, is a desktop manager like GNOME or KDE an operating system? I would argue that it is. When you hear my definition of an operating system, you will understand why. In my mind, an Operating System is:
A collection of components that work together atop a general purpose machine to make a consistent interface that is more conducive to a particular purpose.
You may be wondering why I care so much about what constitutes an OS. The answer is pretty simple. If we redefine an OS like this, an OS gains a property that I believe to be essential to the challenges of computing that lie ahead.
Operating Systems become composable.
Composability is a very important topic in software engineering. In fact, it is a major component of the Unix philosophy that embodies the spirit of most of the successful operating systems in use today.
As the number of different devices grows, so will the number of things we do with those devices. In the same vein, the things we do with those devices, we will inherently want to be able to reproduce on other devices, from slight changes in marketed products, to full on simulations in different environments.
Moving our definition of an Operating System away from the metal, will allow us to define clear, standard interfaces that our operating systems provide along with clear, standard interfaces that our operating systems consume. The technology world will benefit greatly if we put an end to hacking together virtual machines, container solutions, and Operating Systems built on stripped down modified versions of other operating systems.

If building a new abstraction is so painful, that it is easier to copy and paste large chunks of code, you need to rethink the way you are building your abstractions. Building the right abstractions isn't just a time consuming distraction from building software, it is software engineering.
With that out of the way, let me try and explain how I decide what to abstract so that years from now when I'm older some obnoxious young know it all can tell me how I've been doing it wrong :-)
Before I do that, I'd like to first try and paint a picture of a software as something that has a life of its own. When it is born, it is only a small cluster of abstract concepts that fit nicely into a solution for the user. But the days of clear cut simplicity are few, as the application grows it is fed features, design changes and bug fixes. Depending on the process your team used to digest all your application's food, you can end up with a beauty or a beast.
Now let's pair back this analogy to something more mathematical that we can better understand as engineers, let's think of our application as a growing crystal. Your core abstractions sit on the inside, and all the features, changes and fixes it is fed cause new abstractions to crystalize around the old ones.
Each addition to the crystal should only contain the thing that makes that abstraction unique, and for the parts that are not unique, it should attach itself to the crystal on which it grows.
What do I mean by attach itself? Well, say I have a user info form and a user info dialog. If I'm following the rule of three, I would just copy the form and be on with my day. Then, two weeks later, developer John Smith joins the project and has no clue about the user info forms. He gets a story to add a user info sidebar, so he looks for a user info form and all he has to do is copy it into the sidebar and presto chango! Meanwhile, it is time to add a field to the user info form (it is required, sorry). The change was easy, but with it, we just broke a dialog and sidebar.
If you were to attach it to the abstractions that are already there, you would compose the form into your new dialog abstraction, and then two weeks later, when John Smith joins the project, you tell him, we go by this philosophy and you link him here. Then, when he needs to add the form to the sidebar, he knows that copy pasting is not okay, and he builds a sidebar component that composes the form. The time comes to add the field to the form, you don't even need to think about anything on the crystal further out than your abstraction because as long as you are meeting the basic expectations of all the users of your abstraction, all of your changes should successfully propagate throughout your app without you having to break a sweat.
Using this technique, so long as you maintain clear interfaces for using your abstraction, when you make a change to it, you only need to worry about the part of your crystal that is directly adjacent towards the inside. This allows you to think in the context of the abstraction you are working on and not have to worry about fringe complexity that was added in after the fact.</p><div class="action has-text-right"><a href=/2016/06/21/crystallize-carfully/ class="button is-primary">Read more</a></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></section><section class=section><div class=container><div class=columns><div class="column is-centered-tablet-portrait"><h1 class="title section-title">ace</h1><h5 class="subtitle is-5 is-muted"></h5><div class=divider></div><div class=section><div class=container><div class=columns></div><div class=columns><div class="column is-4"><div class=box><figure class="image is-3by2"><a href=/2014/07/28/wishlist-coding-in-the-cloud-without-falling/><img src=/images/default_summary_hu2be732aee21a2469ead3fe1f2df8caca_2088687_600x0_resize_q75_box.jpg alt></a></figure><h3 class="title is-5 refresh-summary-title">Wishlist: Coding in the Cloud (without falling from the sky)</h3><p class=refresh-summary>As a diehard Google fanboy, it is my duty to figure out how I can switch to a Chromebook as my primary laptop. The only way I can see myself doing that is if I were provided a web based programming experience that was better than coding on metal.
Enter Bryan&amp;rsquo;s fantasy world, where a flourishing space economy affords us with cheap vacations to the moon and once a year visits to grandma on the mars colony. Err&amp;hellip; I mean where there is a really cool way to work on code in the cloud.
I started my version of this in 2012 in meteorjs, I called the project meteorite (everyone who knows meteor is laughing at me right now). It was a very primitive project where you start a meteor server and others could load it up and collaborate on changes that synced to your filesystem.
I recently started giving it a once over to see if I could get it up to snuff for my recent ideas on tightening the communication gap in something like a git workflow.
As I pulled the open source threads I found many projects from a github account by the name of mad-eye useful. After I quick search, I realized it was because they were doing exactly what I was trying to do.
I was about to abandon the idea when I thought about how receptive my company is to feedback and suggestions from customers. So here it is, my first of what will hopefully be many wishlists.
Wishlist
A single source of truth that my whole team can work on simultaneously The ability for each team member to live check out a version of the codebase that has either been vetted or written by that member The ability to live check out a version of the codebase that has been vetted by every member of the team (for production) The ability to accept changes made by team members and see who has accepted which pieces of code This would mean turning most people&amp;rsquo;s git workflows inside out. Instead of patches and commits going into a central repository when a consensus is reached on their quality, they make their way from a central source of truth out to each individual&amp;rsquo;s server where they run their own version of the code with code that excludes code they have not yet accepted.
Not only would this eliminate merge conflicts
It would improve communication and make modeling complex problems a much more fluid team experience akin to working on a structure in minecraft.
Since I will probably never get around to doing this on my own, I figured I would share my two cents. Hope it makes your roadmap :-)</p><div class="action has-text-right"><a href=/2014/07/28/wishlist-coding-in-the-cloud-without-falling/ class="button is-primary">Read more</a></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></section><section class=section><div class=container><div class=columns><div class="column is-centered-tablet-portrait"><h1 class="title section-title">advice</h1><h5 class="subtitle is-5 is-muted"></h5><div class=divider></div><div class=section><div class=container><div class=columns></div><div class=columns><div class="column is-4"><div class=box><figure class="image is-3by2"><a href=/2014/07/27/wishlist-series/><img src=/images/default_summary_hu2be732aee21a2469ead3fe1f2df8caca_2088687_600x0_resize_q75_box.jpg alt></a></figure><h3 class="title is-5 refresh-summary-title">Wishlist Series</h3><p class=refresh-summary>Those of you who know me already know I am a man of many wishes and dreams.

When I work occasionally to get these projects out of my head and into code, I will pull on any open source threads I am given. The really cool part about this is I usually end up finding the people who are already trying to do what I am setting out to do. Most of the time, they are way ahead of me.
My usual course of action is to abandon yet another project and move on with my life, knowing full well that it meant forgetting about the hand full of cool (from my perspective at least) feature sets I had planned for my project that did not match up with the one I found.
No more! Henceforth, I will provide at no cost (worth the price), my good advice. Posts will be wishlist themed and tweeted aggressively at the company I think is closest to my fantasy product.

Finally, we have to maintain a fleet of balloons. Helium is expensive and we would need to make sure each balloon has power, pellets, helium, and a functional microcontroller. While this is daunting, companies have attempted to maintain fleets of balloons in the past, so again, should be doable.
Now I won’t pretend my proposed solution is perfectly safe, or that payloads scale in a perfectly linear fashion, but it seems to make significant leaps in solving both of these issues as well as many others, including reusability.
Future work Seeing as this is the culmination of lots of shower thoughts, and that I’ve never worked in the aerospace industry, there is still lots of work to be done pressure testing the idea.
Parameter setting — set the mass and velocity of the projectiles, determine number of balloons and surface are of balloon network Prove energy transfer to balloons — microwave, solar, etc Network balloons through hardware and/or software — can you share resources between them, stabilize each other Prove that electromagnetic gun can rapid fire light projectiles to satisfy parameters Prove that projectile collection or in air manufacturing is possible I hope that I get a chance to take some of these on in the future. But I’m also interested to hear what other people’s thoughts are. Has anyone explored something similar? Are there obvious things that I missed?</p><div class="action has-text-right"><a href=/post/2019-08-07-high-altitude-mass-volley/ class="button is-primary">Read more</a></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></section><section class=section><div class=container><div class=columns><div class="column is-centered-tablet-portrait"><h1 class="title section-title">ai</h1><h5 class="subtitle is-5 is-muted"></h5><div class=divider></div><div class=section><div class=container><div class=columns></div><div class=columns><div class="column is-4"><div class=box><figure class="image is-3by2"><a href=/2013/11/23/machine-learning-in-go/><img src=/images/default_summary_hu2be732aee21a2469ead3fe1f2df8caca_2088687_600x0_resize_q75_box.jpg alt></a></figure><h3 class="title is-5 refresh-summary-title">Machine Learning in Go</h3><p class=refresh-summary>For a while now I have been curious about Go. There doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem to be much to it, but it is getting more and more popular. Another itch I&amp;rsquo;ve had for a really long time is to write my own machine learning/AI framework. After looking at Golang a bit more, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t shake the feeling that it would be the perfect language for my machine learning framework.
I did some searching and while there were people talking about writing machine learning frameworks in Go, no one was actually doing it. There was some mention of having the science and mathematics packages built up before they implement machine learning because most of the papers are written using mathematical formulas that aren&amp;rsquo;t easy to implement.
This made me even more excited because I&amp;rsquo;m of the opinion that implementing research papers would deliver much less value than engineering the framework with research as an inspiration.
When will I be ready to release this framework? The truth is I don&amp;rsquo;t know, I just wanted to mention that it is in the works incase you stumble across a post I write about Go and wonder, what the heck does he know about Go?</p><div class="action has-text-right"><a href=/2013/11/23/machine-learning-in-go/ class="button is-primary">Read more</a></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></section><section class=section><div class=container><div class=columns><div class="column is-centered-tablet-portrait"><h1 class="title section-title">android</h1><h5 class="subtitle is-5 is-muted"></h5><div class=divider></div><div class=section><div class=container><div class=columns></div><div class=columns><div class="column is-4"><div class=box><figure class="image is-3by2"><a href=/2015/03/11/web-development-on-a-nexus-9/><img src=/images/default_summary_hu2be732aee21a2469ead3fe1f2df8caca_2088687_600x0_resize_q75_box.jpg alt></a></figure><h3 class="title is-5 refresh-summary-title">Web Development on a Nexus 9</h3><p class=refresh-summary>Linode I tried a few AWS boxes at first, but in the end I wound up choosing Linode. Feel free to use the host of your choosing, or host your own box if that’s your cup of tea.
I set up an ubuntu box with a ruby on rails dev environment. The only thing that I had to set up out of the ordinary was XVFB. This is because I have browser tests that run and need an X server even though it is headless. One snag with this, after you get XVFB running, don’t forget to tell your application which display to connect to (for me it was setting the $DISPLAY environment variable).
JuiceSSH On my Nexus 9, I chose JuiceSSH as my SSH client since it has a nice UI and makes ssh tunneling easy.
First I set up a normal connection to my Linode server, follow the instructions that linode gives you.
Next you need to tunnel your dev server port. JuiceSSH makes this easy, just go to your connections and swipe left. Then you will be able to access the dev server of your website from your android.
External Keyboard Helper Pro You will need a bluetooth keyboard of your choosing, the keyboard case is good if you are on the go, but I am much more comfortable on a slightly larger keyboard.
Like many developers, there is at least one key on the keyboard you will need to remap. That key is caps lock. Since all developer’s know caps lock is supposed to be control, this one is a no brainer.
This is pretty easy to do.
On the keyboard case for the Nexus 9, it is a search button. I haven’t found a way to remap it yet, but if you are able to I’d love to hear from you.
What’s missing? Chrome Inspector Remote Chrome Inspecting works fine if you are trying to debug a phone, but what if you are making your tablet a dev environment? There needs to be a better way to inspect a page from a tablet.
Remapping Search Key =&amp;gt; Control This one is just silly. I can remap any key with External Keyboard Helper Pro, but the search key is above it.

Excuse me? What century are we in?
Let me clarify, when I am running linux in a container to build applications the operating system should not be bothering me with arbitrary user systems.
When was the last time you logged into a multi-user unix system that had other users on it? Was it in your CS department in college? Me too.
We don't share computers anymore, even toddlers get their own phones with more computing power than you had in your desktop when Linux was born. Not only do we not share computers, it is actually the opposite, computers share us. Many companies have figured that out by now, using the &amp;ldquo;cloud&amp;rdquo; to build multi computer operating systems.
So I say no one is actually leveraging multi user linux systems in a way that is intuitive, and you say, well what about enterprise and large institutions. Well, if they are managing servers that multiple people log into, they should probably think about modernizing the way they orchestrate their systems.
Let me explain what I mean, and to do so I will divide up the uses of Linux into two categories.
Running a remote service for people to use. Running a local machine for someone to use. When solving for the first, you might say, &amp;ldquo;I want all my users to log in and have complete access to a unix environment.&amp;rdquo; To that, I would ask &amp;ldquo;Do you really need a whole unix environment to use service, or can you build a more direct interface?&amp;rdquo; If the answer is you need a unix environment, I would say, you should build containers for your users and log them into containers. However, the answer is much more likely to be no, we just need our users to check their email, to which I would say, you probably just want to run an email service and have it communicate with some central authorization service. To that you might say, &amp;ldquo;That is exactly what I'll do, except I'll just use unix permissions for my authorization because it is there.&amp;rdquo; To that I would ask, &amp;ldquo;Do you really want your service authorization coupled to your computer operating system?&amp;rdquo; Operating systems are made to run hardware to the point where it becomes a generic, pluggable system to run software. What if you got new hardware that was better, but required a different operating system, do you want to port your authorization to the new system? A better way to solve this problem, would be to look for a solid, system independent authorization module and use that.
Now how about the second use case? This takes us back to the fact that we no longer share computers, and if we did, it wouldn't be the responsibility of the computer operating system to manage this, it would be a service on top. Let's look at android for instance, now I will admit I don't know a whole lot about how the internals relate to linux, but I do know what the security focus has been on, and it hasn't been user level security, it has been app level. Users install software from a plethora of sources, and they don't fully understand the consequences of doing so. A system like android has built authorization and sandboxing around each application, giving it permission to access only what it needs to do the job it has. That isn't to say that android doesn't leverage the multi-user nature of linux, but it certainly doesn't need to, and it doesn't exactly fit cleanly into the paradigm of multi-system users that it is building for.
I am happy to have a discussion about this (maybe it already exists), but I would love to see a version of linux that did away with multiple users and instead focused on app level security.

It involved clearly abstracted pieces of our system being clearly and purposefully coupled. If this doesn&amp;rsquo;t bring you to your knees let me try and illustrate why this is so bad.
You are the kind of developer that pardon my french, &amp;ldquo;gets shit done.&amp;rdquo; Because you are such a doer, you connect the first input with the desired output. You repeat this with a different input and output a few times. Then you have two inputs that have the same desired outcome so you hook that up. Then maybe you depend on that output as the input to something else you need to decide on. This keeps going on taking whatever input is needed for the job and producing the desired outcome on the system. Eventually this happens.
Quick homework, look at the system we&amp;rsquo;ve produced and figure out what action caused what, and what state the system is in, and what will happen if you change a piece.
Now imagine instead of just &amp;ldquo;making it happen&amp;rdquo; you built your system as small, well tested tools that adhere to standard interfaces that can be moved around easily and used with each other fluidly. You&amp;rsquo;d have something closer to this.
Now where do you draw the lines between your tools? How do you create the interfaces? Aren&amp;rsquo;t the lines just imaginary?
These are questions that may cause you to dismiss the need, but think about the lego. Are there other ways lego could have made bricks fit together in a consistent fashion? Would the building blocks have been just as successful? Yes the lines are imaginary, and no it really doesn&amp;rsquo;t make so much of a difference where you draw them. The important thing is that they are consistent and you stick with them, even if it means rethinking a minor detail in a feature, because if you don&amp;rsquo;t, well&amp;hellip;</p><div class="action has-text-right"><a href=/2014/11/15/oo-code-isnt-spaghetti-proof/ class="button is-primary">Read more</a></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></section><section class=section><div class=container><div class=columns><div class="column is-centered-tablet-portrait"><h1 class="title section-title">bookmarklet</h1><h5 class="subtitle is-5 is-muted"></h5><div class=divider></div><div class=section><div class=container><div class=columns></div><div class=columns><div class="column is-4"><div class=box><figure class="image is-3by2"><a href=/2015/12/19/graphiql-bookmarklet/><img src=/images/default_summary_hu2be732aee21a2469ead3fe1f2df8caca_2088687_600x0_resize_q75_box.jpg alt></a></figure><h3 class="title is-5 refresh-summary-title">GraphiQL Bookmarklet</h3><p class=refresh-summary>I'm sure most of you, if you have done any work with graphql, have heard of graphiql.

The reason for the switch is not what I'm writing to discuss, but I'll just say that the unpredictability of mongodb was starting to become an issue in development. The thought was that if it was already difficult before the data starts pouring in, it will probably be a nightmare one the product is in use. And that meant switching from graffiti-mongoose, to my own graphql database glue.
I searched for an ORM that could take the place of mongoose and it wasn't long before I stumbled upon BookshelfJS. Built alongside its query building counterpart by @tgriesser, it was a good choice of where to start.
Then I had a choice, I could build a graffiti adapter for postgres, but I wanted something more lightweight than graffiti. My graphql schema were more akin to controllers than database models, so the idea of having them exclusively tied to models didn't feel right. I needed custom attributes that were not on my models to be in my graphql schema.
Instead of building a larger solution, I collected helper methods every time I needed to do something related to accessing the bookshelf model. I ended up with a bunch of neat little wrappers to help with bookshelf graphql schema and I spent yesterday putting it together with some tests and documentation to open source.

Look for all the individual places the pattern changed. Check to see that a few of them make sense. Observe how they differ, and maybe search through the code independently looking for parts that may have been missed or intentionally left out. If you find inconsistencies comment and ask about them.
If you agree with the pattern change and you look through them and they all look good, then all you need to do is go through the rest of your normal PR checklist and you’re good to approve it.
If you don’t agree with the pattern change in general, comment on where the pattern could do better. Maybe there is a reason the pattern isn’t that way.
Large feature added If there is a new feature, the first thing to check after you know you want the feature, is all the points where the new code touches existing code. If you find out how it interfaces you can box it in your mind and it will be less overwhelming.
Are the interfaces with the rest of your code standard? Is the new code structured in a way that is consistent with all of your patterns? Is the new code tested? Is the new code integration tested with the rest of the system?
Briefly read through the implementation and check for any faulty assumptions about the existing code. If you find faulty assumptions, point them out so the new feature can be fixed. If you start having common assumptions about different parts of your code that are off, that is a code smell and you should probably address it.
Once you’ve asked all the questions and read through the code, have someone else look at it and then sign off.

Changing standards and updated api's left code fragmented as the codebase grew.
From the time I started working on coffeelint, the problem has been stewing in my head. Subconciously on the lookout for a solution, I heard about codemods. Let me preface by saying I've been quite obsessed with everything facebook engineering has been doing in open source lately. Needless to say I took notice.
I tried to jump in to the game but after playing around with jscodeshift in the super nifty ast explorer I noticed there was a peice missing. Only this time, a mortal human like myself could fill it.
We have been told that facebook has a codemod runner and I have no doubt that there is a bit of process in place governing it. But outside of facebook, we only have a one off runner that is hard to work into a team's process.
Inspired by my desire to solve this problem and an admiration for the way rails handles database migrations I decided to build a code migration tool that wraps jscodeshift. It might be a little rough, since it is hot off the vim, but I'm eager to hear what people think about the concept.

Distribute the square and it becomes πr^2 / 4r^2
Now the r^2 cancels leaving us with a constant!!
π / 4
What does that constant mean? Well if we were leaving the corners of our field for the poor, π / 4 is how much of our produce we would be taking home. So how much does that leave for charity?
1 - π / 4
Okay great, so I just need to give that much charity. So lets say Sally makes 60K a year after taxes, how much does she need to give to live up to the commandments?
(1 - π / 4) * $60,000 = $12,876.11

If building a new abstraction is so painful, that it is easier to copy and paste large chunks of code, you need to rethink the way you are building your abstractions. Building the right abstractions isn't just a time consuming distraction from building software, it is software engineering.
With that out of the way, let me try and explain how I decide what to abstract so that years from now when I'm older some obnoxious young know it all can tell me how I've been doing it wrong :-)
Before I do that, I'd like to first try and paint a picture of a software as something that has a life of its own. When it is born, it is only a small cluster of abstract concepts that fit nicely into a solution for the user. But the days of clear cut simplicity are few, as the application grows it is fed features, design changes and bug fixes. Depending on the process your team used to digest all your application's food, you can end up with a beauty or a beast.
Now let's pair back this analogy to something more mathematical that we can better understand as engineers, let's think of our application as a growing crystal. Your core abstractions sit on the inside, and all the features, changes and fixes it is fed cause new abstractions to crystalize around the old ones.
Each addition to the crystal should only contain the thing that makes that abstraction unique, and for the parts that are not unique, it should attach itself to the crystal on which it grows.
What do I mean by attach itself? Well, say I have a user info form and a user info dialog. If I'm following the rule of three, I would just copy the form and be on with my day. Then, two weeks later, developer John Smith joins the project and has no clue about the user info forms. He gets a story to add a user info sidebar, so he looks for a user info form and all he has to do is copy it into the sidebar and presto chango! Meanwhile, it is time to add a field to the user info form (it is required, sorry). The change was easy, but with it, we just broke a dialog and sidebar.
If you were to attach it to the abstractions that are already there, you would compose the form into your new dialog abstraction, and then two weeks later, when John Smith joins the project, you tell him, we go by this philosophy and you link him here. Then, when he needs to add the form to the sidebar, he knows that copy pasting is not okay, and he builds a sidebar component that composes the form. The time comes to add the field to the form, you don't even need to think about anything on the crystal further out than your abstraction because as long as you are meeting the basic expectations of all the users of your abstraction, all of your changes should successfully propagate throughout your app without you having to break a sweat.
Using this technique, so long as you maintain clear interfaces for using your abstraction, when you make a change to it, you only need to worry about the part of your crystal that is directly adjacent towards the inside. This allows you to think in the context of the abstraction you are working on and not have to worry about fringe complexity that was added in after the fact.</p><div class="action has-text-right"><a href=/2016/06/21/crystallize-carfully/ class="button is-primary">Read more</a></div></div></div><div class="column is-4"><div class=box><figure class="image is-3by2"><a href=/2014/11/26/commit-to-a-single-way/><img src=/images/default_summary_hu2be732aee21a2469ead3fe1f2df8caca_2088687_600x0_resize_q75_box.jpg alt></a></figure><h3 class="title is-5 refresh-summary-title">Commit to a single way</h3><p class=refresh-summary>Software engineers are responsible for adding new and unforeseen complexity to established, carefully thought out systems.
It tends to be a reflex when told to add complexity, that we special case the complexity and fall through to the system you had before. This works in many cases and is great if the complexity being added is a footnote that you don&amp;rsquo;t intend to come back to.
Complexity that is essential to the long term success of your product needs to be &amp;ldquo;native.&amp;rdquo;
However, if it is a new direction your product is taking, or a major piece of functionality you anticipate growing, then that reflex is a dangerous one. Try and think of the new complexity in terms of the whole native vs third party debate. When something is native it integrates flawlessly into the existing system, when it is third party it has a few touch points and exists separately. Complexity that is essential to the long term success of your product needs to be &amp;ldquo;native.&amp;rdquo;
How do I make complexity &amp;ldquo;native&amp;rdquo; in my system? Well it&amp;rsquo;s simple, instead of taking the existing system and sticking the new feature in, imagine a new system that the feature is a living breathing part of, then fit the old system inside it. By committing to this &amp;ldquo;one way&amp;rdquo; of doing things in your system (or at least as few as you can), you reduce fragmentation and make things easy to understand and improve upon.</p><div class="action has-text-right"><a href=/2014/11/26/commit-to-a-single-way/ class="button is-primary">Read more</a></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></section><section class=section><div class=container><div class=columns><div class="column is-centered-tablet-portrait"><h1 class="title section-title">computer science</h1><h5 class="subtitle is-5 is-muted"></h5><div class=divider></div><div class=section><div class=container><div class=columns></div><div class=columns><div class="column is-4"><div class=box><figure class="image is-3by2"><a href=/2014/11/18/a-rosefactory-by-any-other-name/><img src=/images/default_summary_hu2be732aee21a2469ead3fe1f2df8caca_2088687_600x0_resize_q75_box.jpg alt></a></figure><h3 class="title is-5 refresh-summary-title">A RoseFactory by any other name...</h3><p class=refresh-summary>What about if you were creating new furniture pieces and putting them together? You would need some consistency in your succinct descriptions otherwise you wouldn’t be able to tell what fits with what.
For instance if you were describing the front and back leg of your couch, and the descriptions were completely different, if you changed a subtle detail in the vanir, it wouldn’t be obvious what other pieces needed to change. On the other hand, if the descriptions were identical, it wouldn’t be clear the the pieces were mirror image of each other.
How do we achieve that level of consistency without over generalizing? The answer is as you may expect, very carefully. Why do you think software engineers make so much money?
A large portion of any software engineers day is spent deciding what to call this or that, and whether a name still describes a piece that has changed. Automate the solution to that problem and you’re a great deal closer to creating a robotic software engineer.</p><div class="action has-text-right"><a href=/2014/11/18/a-rosefactory-by-any-other-name/ class="button is-primary">Read more</a></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></section><section class=section><div class=container><div class=columns><div class="column is-centered-tablet-portrait"><h1 class="title section-title">covid19</h1><h5 class="subtitle is-5 is-muted"></h5><div class=divider></div><div class=section><div class=container><div class=columns></div><div class=columns><div class="column is-4"><div class=box><figure class="image is-3by2"><a href=/post/2020-04-05-quarantine-workout/><img src=/images/default_summary_hu2be732aee21a2469ead3fe1f2df8caca_2088687_600x0_resize_q75_box.jpg alt></a></figure><h3 class="title is-5 refresh-summary-title">Quarantine Rule #1: Exercise every day</h3><p class=refresh-summary>It may sound like a lot, but if you are like me and your quarantine space is limited to a studio apartment, then it is probably the most essential thing you can do to stay sane. The three groups of exercise I alternate between are:
Anaerobic Aerobic Stretching As an experienced introvert, it may not come as a surprise to you that exercise is one of the things I tend to go long periods neglecting, but in this new COVID-19 world, I decided it was mission critical so I went on a YouTube research quest to figure out what I was going to do for exercise.
My goals on this quest were to get a good anaerobic workout that didn’t take too much time or require any special equipment. After devising my super sophisticated research plan, I typed “workout” into youtube and started scrolling through the results. My hypothesis was that if I wanted to get a good workout, I need to find someone who has a similar body type to me. This means that as much as I wanted to get my workout information from the attractive young lady, I chose a video by a smallish frame asian dude who’s muscles I could imagine wearing.
Since the goal of this blogpost isn’t to endorse my youtube workout coach I will not post a link, but I did like the video very much because it explained the reasoning behind all the workout decisions and talked about how many reps you should do in terms of how many you can do rather than giving a specific number. Also, because the trainer was targeting COVID watchers, the only equipment I needed for this workout was two sheets with a knot tied to hang over the door.
The video recommends only doing the workout every other day, but I need to work out every day for my sanity, this means I need some kind of an aerobic workout. Now, my usual solution would be to play music and jump around until I’m sweaty, but I noticed this was too time consuming as it would take me awhile to get tired. I also noticed that sitting at a desk for a long time was making me feel lousy.
This is when I decided to buy a mini elliptical to put under my improvised standing desk. This way I can work while doing my aerobics so it is okay if it takes a bit longer. This has a small impact on shower planning, but I am confident you can figure that out.
Finally, after a week of alternating between full body and aerobic workouts, you may find at the end of the week that you are just exhausted and can’t do it anymore. At least, that is what happened to me. That is when I decided to designate a stretching day. Stretching day came when my muscles were just not willing to do another workout. On stretching day, I went on YouTube and searched for stretches for the parts of my body that ached and after watching a flamboyant doctor tell me all the ways I should bend to loosen the muscles that were tight, I felt a lot better.
Hopefully walking you through my experience with exercising in quarantine will give you the motivation you need to get YouTube fired up and do some exercising yourself. Stay tuned for the rest of my quarantutorials.</p><div class="action has-text-right"><a href=/post/2020-04-05-quarantine-workout/ class="button is-primary">Read more</a></div></div></div><div class="column is-4"><div class=box><figure class="image is-3by2"><a href=/post/2020-04-05-quarantine-life/><img src=/images/default_summary_hu2be732aee21a2469ead3fe1f2df8caca_2088687_600x0_resize_q75_box.jpg alt></a></figure><h3 class="title is-5 refresh-summary-title">Quarantine Tips from Experienced Introvert</h3><p class=refresh-summary>The year is 2003.

I spent the first few days figuring out how I want to flavor my soylent. I went through different peanut butter and chocolate combos until I decided to ditch the peanut butter, go for simple cocoa powder, and add sugar.
The difference in how I felt after soylent was immediately clear. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t perfect, but it was better. The pain I felt drinking it was very dull and almost unnoticeable. Because of this, I started drinking soylent almost exclusively without even setting out to.
When I notice the trend I got a little more serious about it. By the second day, the only pain I felt was when I applied pressure to the areas of my intestine that are affected by crohn&amp;rsquo;s. Coming from being in immense pain after every meal, I was ecstatic.
By day three or four, I was entirely pain free.** Now, this hardly constitutes a study and there are plenty of other variables that haven&amp;rsquo;t been isolated, but I&amp;rsquo;m going to call it a success so far.

I spent the first few days figuring out how I want to flavor my soylent. I went through different peanut butter and chocolate combos until I decided to ditch the peanut butter, go for simple cocoa powder, and add sugar.
The difference in how I felt after soylent was immediately clear. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t perfect, but it was better. The pain I felt drinking it was very dull and almost unnoticeable. Because of this, I started drinking soylent almost exclusively without even setting out to.
When I notice the trend I got a little more serious about it. By the second day, the only pain I felt was when I applied pressure to the areas of my intestine that are affected by crohn&amp;rsquo;s. Coming from being in immense pain after every meal, I was ecstatic.
By day three or four, I was entirely pain free.** Now, this hardly constitutes a study and there are plenty of other variables that haven&amp;rsquo;t been isolated, but I&amp;rsquo;m going to call it a success so far.

The only thing that keeps me coming back to the place is that I have a really nice pharmacist named Bobby. I wish I could take him with me when I go somewhere else, but I know I can’t.
Otherwise, the place is kept a mess, not unorganized, just down right dirty. The prices are a joke and it shows that the staff is not treated right by the way they carry themselves.
One time I was given pills from the pharmacy that were covered in dust from other pills. When I went back to get new pills, they said that it happens all the time, it is just pill dust from the sorter. Pill dust from the sorter? So you mean when I get a bottle of pills from your pharmacy I’m really getting prescription drug suprisé?
The pharmacist was super nice about it (I’m not sure what it is but pharmacists are usually really nice people). She gave me my pills and I said nothing about it because I could chalk it up to an honest mistake.
I bought an umbrella from the same store, which they sell with all these quality guarantees, and when it turned inside out and ripped two weeks later I went to return it. The manager wouldn’t take it back and he was kind of a dick about it. To be clear, I spend ~$200 a month at this place, I at least expected a little respect.
I’m not angry at how I’ve been mistreated by CVS, just very sad.
Edit: Added in pharmacist&amp;rsquo;s name so everyone can know that he is a good guy. Upon transferring my prescription I had to explain to Bobby why I was leaving. At first he seemed angry at whoever had given me a bad experience, but then my story wasn&amp;rsquo;t really that compelling. After all it comes down to an umbrella. And while it isn&amp;rsquo;t the only reason, it was the last straw. I do my job thoroughly and with pride, Bobby does his job in the same manner. It is difficult for me to continue giving my patronage after learning that the store manager does not hold himself to similar standards. Edit 2: I've had a great experience since I moved to Walgreens. My pharmacist at Walgreens was nice and professional and when I moved apartments and switched to the Walgreens closer I met his brother and he is a great pharmacist.
I'm not one to hold a grudge, but I have no reason to settle.
Also, Duane Reade is kept much cleaner than CVS.</p><div class="action has-text-right"><a href=/2014/05/09/my-breakup-with-cvs-after-7-years-of-patronage/ class="button is-primary">Read more</a></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></section><section class=section><div class=container><div class=columns><div class="column is-centered-tablet-portrait"><h1 class="title section-title">dev</h1><h5 class="subtitle is-5 is-muted"></h5><div class=divider></div><div class=section><div class=container><div class=columns></div><div class=columns><div class="column is-4"><div class=box><figure class="image is-3by2"><a href=/2015/06/02/avoiding-tunnel-vision/><img src=/images/default_summary_hu2be732aee21a2469ead3fe1f2df8caca_2088687_600x0_resize_q75_box.jpg alt></a></figure><h3 class="title is-5 refresh-summary-title">Avoiding Tunnel Vision</h3><p class=refresh-summary>Now I’ve never had trouble finding jobs in the past when I was looking for full time work, but recently I’ve had a change of heart. I decided that in order to avoid getting stuck on one problem, one team, one process and building stress over the imperfection that lies in between, I would keep myself occupied with more than one project.
Now I may not be the best developer that ever lived, but I’ve worked several years in the industry and I’ve gotten 98 LinkedIn profile views in the last 90 days and get a message about a development job every day or two without any outbound searching, so there is a good chance I’m not the worst.
Aside from the companies I have good personal relationships with already, employers are allergic to part time contracts. Don’t get me wrong, it isn’t hard to see why. The arguments given in the answer to this closed StackExchange question are completely valid, but I would like to make a case for part time development.
There are many reasons to go after part time development contracts that don’t involve being lazy. In my case, it is to keep my mind fresh and avoid tunnel vision.
When we stare at a problem too long we lose perspective on it, we focus on details that don’t matter, we get caught up on things that aren’t worth our attention.
When we step away and come back to a problem after thinking about something else, our minds are refreshed and we can think objectively about it.
This principle is complicated by the fact that a whole team is focused on the same problems for long periods of time. Disagreements are bound to surface, stubbornness is bound to win out over reason, and politics will likely decide the outcome.
I’m not saying we ditch full time contracts/jobs, I’m just suggesting we let those who want to step back and refresh their outlook do so.</p><div class="action has-text-right"><a href=/2015/06/02/avoiding-tunnel-vision/ class="button is-primary">Read more</a></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></section><section class=section><div class=container><div class=columns><div class="column is-centered-tablet-portrait"><h1 class="title section-title">development</h1><h5 class="subtitle is-5 is-muted"></h5><div class=divider></div><div class=section><div class=container><div class=columns></div><div class=columns><div class="column is-4"><div class=box><figure class="image is-3by2"><a href=/2015/04/29/chromebook-search-ctrl/><img src=/images/default_summary_hu2be732aee21a2469ead3fe1f2df8caca_2088687_600x0_resize_q75_box.jpg alt></a></figure><h3 class="title is-5 refresh-summary-title">Wishlist: Chromebook search/ctrl</h3><p class=refresh-summary>In order to do development on my Chromebook, I need to change the search key to a control key.

My first reaction to them when I started programming in the real world was to scorn them with the attitude that they introduce unnecessary complication for both the developer and the computer. What good could they possibly do?
Like any programmer thrown into a stack, I faithfully used the established patterns, knowing that any divergence from the standard usually has a much worse effect than dealing with it.
Over time, I grew to like DSLs. Why? Why would a rational developer like myself grow to like something so senseless? As Sandy Metz said once in a talk she gave at Pivotal Labs, trust your gut. Much of your high level thought as a developer, you may not be able to verbalize immediately.
So I trusted myself, and continued using DSLs. Until one day it came to me while I was pairing. The value of a DSL is that it forces the human brain to switch contexts. This makes it much easier to move throughout the code without mashing up context from one problem with another, it’s like namespacing for the brain.</p><div class="action has-text-right"><a href=/2014/12/19/contextualizing-with-dsls/ class="button is-primary">Read more</a></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></section><section class=section><div class=container><div class=columns><div class="column is-centered-tablet-portrait"><h1 class="title section-title">emberjs</h1><h5 class="subtitle is-5 is-muted"></h5><div class=divider></div><div class=section><div class=container><div class=columns></div><div class=columns><div class="column is-4"><div class=box><figure class="image is-3by2"><a href=/2016/04/01/imaginary-lines/><img src=/images/default_summary_hu2be732aee21a2469ead3fe1f2df8caca_2088687_600x0_resize_q75_box.jpg alt></a></figure><h3 class="title is-5 refresh-summary-title">Imaginary Lines</h3><p class=refresh-summary>If I had to sum up the job of a software engineer in laymen's terms, I would tell you that we draw imaginary lines around imaginary concepts until those concepts can map to both a specific set of instructions for a machine and a common understanding for programmers.
Why am I stating the obvious? Well, it is quite simply to emphasize just how important it is where we draw those lines.
To illustrate this, lets start all the way on the left side of the machine instruction / common understanding spectrum. By that I mean a simple procedural program. This program needs to do a list of technological things. For instance, it needs to take input, process the input and react to it, displaying some output.
As my list of instructions grows, my understandability shrinks. But I'm a software engineer, I can fix this! If we just split up our code into separate responsabilities, the complexity is managed.
So now we have a place to put code that handles input, a place to put code that handles business logic and a place to format my output. However, the complexity of our code is not done growing. We now have different types of input, more rules to apply to process the input, and multiple ways of displaying the same input. But I'm a software engineer, I can fix this.
Lets get more specific about responsabilities, we can split the input set and handle different kinds of input in different places, some of our business logic does one thing to our data while other business logic does another thing, we can split that up, and we can create decorators for all the ways we need to display our state!
After all that complexity management, I think it is time to meet with the client and show them how cool their app is going to be. Enter client&amp;hellip; &amp;lsquo;wow, great work you guys, I hope it isn't a problem that we are thinking about changing widgets to have round tuits and respond to thingy mabobers.&amp;rsquo;
Now we realize our mistake. We've been so busy putting everything in our neat little piles, we didn't realize that the imaginary lines we've been drawing to do it were around concepts completely tangential to our domain. Meaning, in order to change a concept, we need to change it in 40 places neatly hidden by gems that magically composes services so you don't have to think about them. By the time we are done tracking down the things we need to change, we better cross our fingers and hope it all still works (Or run our test suit that grows exponentially in size).
So we've learned our lesson, what do we do differently next time? How do we avoid the same mistake? The answer to that is quite simple, draw your imaginary lines along your domain, rather than your technologies.
What does that mean in the real world?

Before I go into the solution, let’s look at the problem. At present, out best way of getting to space involves stacking explosives as high as we can, sitting on top with a countdown, and hoping that we planned for all the eventualities.
Setting aside the risk to life and property involved in this, we have the issue of more weight requiring more fuel, which is in turn, more weight. This makes it so launching payloads doesn’t scale linearly.
Inspirational work This all started with a jump back in time to Newton’s cannonball. It certainly would solve for having to carry that pesky fuel? The problem with this, is that if you want to reach orbital velocity, not even accounting for air resistance, the acceleration required would be more than enough to kill you.
But we are determined to get to space! Violent acceleration can’t stop us. What about a train? Those accelerate slowly and get going really fast. This is actually a great idea. You would need a massively long train, but something like Elon Musk’s hyperloop might do. Aside from the capital costs of this approach, we have to deal with air resistance when we exit the hyperloop. This could potentially be solved by building a hyperloop muzzle that ascends into the sky to where the air is thin. I am a huge fan of this idea and it would drastically lower the cost of sending things to space if we are able to invest enough upfront to make it happen. But is there a way we can do something at lower cost now? Can we overcome the challenge of acceleration, fuel weight, and air resistance without being united in the effort by another cold war?
Back to the basics If we think back to the cannon, it works, we can accelerate small pellets past escape velocity with current technology and we have very sophisticated targeting software that could hit a target from very far away. What if we just had a lot of very small guns shooting a space ship to propel it to orbit?
There are more than a couple problems with this, including:
air resistance turbulence complicating targeting obstructions blocking the craft wear on the craft from impact collecting projectiles But if done right, this approach could be very desirable. It could allow our payload to have almost no sophistication, which would make reusability much easier. It also could tie into an electrical grid, which would make it cheap.
Wear on the craft is the easiest to solve. We can use electromagnetic projectiles, or even just make the projectiles very soft and light.
Second easiest to solve for is collection. With a little bit of sophistication on our craft, we can collect the pellets and fire them back at collectors, or without sophistication, we can place collectors where the mass will fall.
Finally, air resistance, turbulence and other atmospheric obstructions are where we really start to scratch our heads. Could these be show stoppers?
Proposal What if we put these little projectile accelerators at the top of the atmosphere? How would we do that? Balloons. If we launched a network of balloons that functioned to fire tiny projectiles rapidly at high velocities, we get a new set of problems, but not ones that can’t be solved.
New problems:
Power Getting payload to upper atmosphere Collecting projectiles (harder) Maintaining balloon fleet Since we are no longer in the ground, we can’t tap into the grid directly, but we can use a combination of solar and microwave charging.
It is harder to fly a payload to high altitude than it is to go from the ground, but airplanes do a pretty good job of that.
The last two are the harder ones, but not unsolvable. For collecting pellets, the payload would have to be equipped with something to catch the pellets and fire them back. Ideally with some kind of targeting pellet spray nozzle with the ability to spread the pellets accross many collectors. The balloons would need to redistribute the pellets amongst themselves. This could be through phisical links between balloons or by relaying shots between balloons. While this is hard, it is not impossible. One way the collection problem could be circumvented, is by making dry ice and not worrying about collection. Would cost a bit more energy, but may be a good fallback.
Finally, we have to maintain a fleet of balloons. Helium is expensive and we would need to make sure each balloon has power, pellets, helium, and a functional microcontroller. While this is daunting, companies have attempted to maintain fleets of balloons in the past, so again, should be doable.
Now I won’t pretend my proposed solution is perfectly safe, or that payloads scale in a perfectly linear fashion, but it seems to make significant leaps in solving both of these issues as well as many others, including reusability.
Future work Seeing as this is the culmination of lots of shower thoughts, and that I’ve never worked in the aerospace industry, there is still lots of work to be done pressure testing the idea.
Parameter setting — set the mass and velocity of the projectiles, determine number of balloons and surface are of balloon network Prove energy transfer to balloons — microwave, solar, etc Network balloons through hardware and/or software — can you share resources between them, stabilize each other Prove that electromagnetic gun can rapid fire light projectiles to satisfy parameters Prove that projectile collection or in air manufacturing is possible I hope that I get a chance to take some of these on in the future. But I’m also interested to hear what other people’s thoughts are. Has anyone explored something similar? Are there obvious things that I missed?</p><div class="action has-text-right"><a href=/post/2019-08-07-high-altitude-mass-volley/ class="button is-primary">Read more</a></div></div></div><div class="column is-4"><div class=box><figure class="image is-3by2"><a href=/2016/06/21/crystallize-carfully/><img src=/images/default_summary_hu2be732aee21a2469ead3fe1f2df8caca_2088687_600x0_resize_q75_box.jpg alt></a></figure><h3 class="title is-5 refresh-summary-title">Crystallize your abstractions carefully...</h3><p class=refresh-summary>For as long as I've been a developer I have been reminded of the rule of three for refactoring and every time I hear it, I die a little inside.
If building a new abstraction is so painful, that it is easier to copy and paste large chunks of code, you need to rethink the way you are building your abstractions. Building the right abstractions isn't just a time consuming distraction from building software, it is software engineering.
With that out of the way, let me try and explain how I decide what to abstract so that years from now when I'm older some obnoxious young know it all can tell me how I've been doing it wrong :-)
Before I do that, I'd like to first try and paint a picture of a software as something that has a life of its own. When it is born, it is only a small cluster of abstract concepts that fit nicely into a solution for the user. But the days of clear cut simplicity are few, as the application grows it is fed features, design changes and bug fixes. Depending on the process your team used to digest all your application's food, you can end up with a beauty or a beast.
Now let's pair back this analogy to something more mathematical that we can better understand as engineers, let's think of our application as a growing crystal. Your core abstractions sit on the inside, and all the features, changes and fixes it is fed cause new abstractions to crystalize around the old ones.
Each addition to the crystal should only contain the thing that makes that abstraction unique, and for the parts that are not unique, it should attach itself to the crystal on which it grows.
What do I mean by attach itself? Well, say I have a user info form and a user info dialog. If I'm following the rule of three, I would just copy the form and be on with my day. Then, two weeks later, developer John Smith joins the project and has no clue about the user info forms. He gets a story to add a user info sidebar, so he looks for a user info form and all he has to do is copy it into the sidebar and presto chango! Meanwhile, it is time to add a field to the user info form (it is required, sorry). The change was easy, but with it, we just broke a dialog and sidebar.
If you were to attach it to the abstractions that are already there, you would compose the form into your new dialog abstraction, and then two weeks later, when John Smith joins the project, you tell him, we go by this philosophy and you link him here. Then, when he needs to add the form to the sidebar, he knows that copy pasting is not okay, and he builds a sidebar component that composes the form. The time comes to add the field to the form, you don't even need to think about anything on the crystal further out than your abstraction because as long as you are meeting the basic expectations of all the users of your abstraction, all of your changes should successfully propagate throughout your app without you having to break a sweat.
Using this technique, so long as you maintain clear interfaces for using your abstraction, when you make a change to it, you only need to worry about the part of your crystal that is directly adjacent towards the inside. This allows you to think in the context of the abstraction you are working on and not have to worry about fringe complexity that was added in after the fact.</p><div class="action has-text-right"><a href=/2016/06/21/crystallize-carfully/ class="button is-primary">Read more</a></div></div></div><div class="column is-4"><div class=box><figure class="image is-3by2"><a href=/2016/04/01/imaginary-lines/><img src=/images/default_summary_hu2be732aee21a2469ead3fe1f2df8caca_2088687_600x0_resize_q75_box.jpg alt></a></figure><h3 class="title is-5 refresh-summary-title">Imaginary Lines</h3><p class=refresh-summary>If I had to sum up the job of a software engineer in laymen's terms, I would tell you that we draw imaginary lines around imaginary concepts until those concepts can map to both a specific set of instructions for a machine and a common understanding for programmers.

However, a controller that processes a request for a product in a separate file from a model that does logic for the product and another file that displays the product and another file that adds a layer on top of the product for another display, does not follow this principle.</p><div class="action has-text-right"><a href=/2016/04/01/imaginary-lines/ class="button is-primary">Read more</a></div></div></div></div><div class=columns><div class="column is-4"><div class=box><figure class="image is-3by2"><a href=/2014/11/26/commit-to-a-single-way/><img src=/images/default_summary_hu2be732aee21a2469ead3fe1f2df8caca_2088687_600x0_resize_q75_box.jpg alt></a></figure><h3 class="title is-5 refresh-summary-title">Commit to a single way</h3><p class=refresh-summary>Software engineers are responsible for adding new and unforeseen complexity to established, carefully thought out systems.
It tends to be a reflex when told to add complexity, that we special case the complexity and fall through to the system you had before. This works in many cases and is great if the complexity being added is a footnote that you don&amp;rsquo;t intend to come back to.
Complexity that is essential to the long term success of your product needs to be &amp;ldquo;native.&amp;rdquo;
However, if it is a new direction your product is taking, or a major piece of functionality you anticipate growing, then that reflex is a dangerous one. Try and think of the new complexity in terms of the whole native vs third party debate. When something is native it integrates flawlessly into the existing system, when it is third party it has a few touch points and exists separately. Complexity that is essential to the long term success of your product needs to be &amp;ldquo;native.&amp;rdquo;
How do I make complexity &amp;ldquo;native&amp;rdquo; in my system? Well it&amp;rsquo;s simple, instead of taking the existing system and sticking the new feature in, imagine a new system that the feature is a living breathing part of, then fit the old system inside it. By committing to this &amp;ldquo;one way&amp;rdquo; of doing things in your system (or at least as few as you can), you reduce fragmentation and make things easy to understand and improve upon.</p><div class="action has-text-right"><a href=/2014/11/26/commit-to-a-single-way/ class="button is-primary">Read more</a></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></section><section class=section><div class=container><div class=columns><div class="column is-centered-tablet-portrait"><h1 class="title section-title">facebook</h1><h5 class="subtitle is-5 is-muted"></h5><div class=divider></div><div class=section><div class=container><div class=columns></div><div class=columns><div class="column is-4"><div class=box><figure class="image is-3by2"><a href=/2015/07/25/relay-vs-flux/><img src=/images/default_summary_hu2be732aee21a2469ead3fe1f2df8caca_2088687_600x0_resize_q75_box.jpg alt></a></figure><h3 class="title is-5 refresh-summary-title">Will Relay replace Flux?</h3><p class=refresh-summary>Relay is out in preview! Have a look.
When people talk about Relay they think of it as the server-client link in the Facebook stack, but is that really all it is?
Flux still has a place on the client because you need to manage temporary app state, right?
I think it doesn't. Flux is an architecture for unidirectional data flow that separates out input from the user and the server so that it can react without getting tangled up. It does so at the high cost of tremendous verbosity and a significant drop in top down readability.
Enter Relay. Relay is a higher level abstraction that wraps React components in containers that declaratively specify data to sync with the server. Since Relay uses GraphQL to communicate with the server, it doesn't seem like there is a solution for temporary app state. Relay does, however, provide a much cleaner way to organize the data of your app, so why would you go back to Flux instead of creating a solution on the same level of abstraction?
GraphQL server in the browser? Why not? You could create an in-memory GraphQL database for temporary app state if you need to.
React transmit is a Relay framework which replaces GraphQL with plain old JS Promises. I have been using it for the time being to structure the data of my apps. I have also been fortunate enough to stumble upon the temporary state issue and solved it the way I suggested above, by querying local stores from Transmit instead of querying the server.
Basically, it needs to choose a random ID between 0 and 999 and keep some memory of which ones have already been chosen.
Here is the client-side store and here is the view that uses it&amp;hellip;

Have a look.
I want to tell you in as few words as possible why I am so excited to get my hands on Relay and GraphQL.
React is widely popular because it is simple and declarative, making it very deterministic and easy to work with. React is also fully composable, making it imensly powerful with high potential for writing reusable code.
Relay is a mirror image of React, except instead of composing beautiful views for the web and native mobile devices using JSX, you can compose data from your database for your views using graphql.

I take out my phone, and open my air travel app and put in Paris. It tells me how much it costs, and I click accept. It takes me to a border patrol and security flow where I need to answer some lame questions, but it isn't so bad.
The app informs me which air shuttle to go to. Since there is one every 10 blocks in Manhattan I don't have to go far. I just need to walk to Chelsea market. When I get to the roof, I see an elevator that has four propellers instead of a wire. I get to the door, and I see a border patrol / security officer on a screen who gives me instructions on how to proceed with the security equipment. When I am done, the gates let me through to the elevator.
When I get in, I wait for the other people I noticed on the security line. When they are done, we take off. We are heading straight up to meet our airplane. The airplanes do regular loops to form a network around the world. They never have to come down except for maintenance since they are refilled by the drone ships. This means there are always planes above to go to. We dock with the airplane and I get out.
I find a seat and look out the window. It is beautiful to look down on a miniature version of the world. I get a notification from my app that in 10 minutes we are crossing paths with the transatlantic loop. I am instructed to wait in the elevator for my transfer, and like a good boy, I do as I'm told.
We get to the transatlantic loop and the plane is a bit more comfortable. They even have snacks and meals for sale. I usually get something because these trips are long and I always forget to bring food.
I spend the plane ride watching videos on my phone with the help of a VR headset gluing it to my face. Before I know it, I get another notification telling me we are nearing the French loop. Again I go wait in the elevator. The plane has a bunch of different faces by the time I go, since we already met the UK loop and the Eurasia loop to exchange passengers.
The next notification I get will be for Paris. I told me friend I was coming so he is meeting me at the Louvre. While I was on the transatlantic loop, I changed my destination so I could land near there. I get the notification, and only have to walk a few blocks and I'm there.

I visited the image in the browser and realized that the browser supported the format, so the broken preview had to be somewhere in filepicker.
In my case I was using a(n) .ico file and since filepicker.io only supports post processing on .jpg and .png I had to come up with a work around.
Once I realized the breakage was in the /convert directive that was automatically filled in for me by the rails gods, the search was on. I dug through the application layer and the gem and I couldn&amp;rsquo;t get it to relinquish its post processing madness.
So I did what any programmer would do. I hacked the preview to use the plain filepicker url instead of decorating it and it worked great™. I used javascript but I&amp;rsquo;m sure the tangled mess you end up different will require different scissors.

Why React? A few months ago, the release of React Native by Facebook convinced me to make the leap to React.
I spent a while working on a React Native app and quickly learned that I needed to bring in Flux. After watching a few videos and reading a few blogs, I added my own implementation of flux to my react native app.
The javascript nature, minimalism, isomorphic potential, and cross platform possibilities were almost too good to be true. I fell in love with the stack and set out to refine the set of tools I'm using around my personal priorities.
Goals Isomorphic app Having the right information at page load is essential Not having to compromise on interactivity is the dream Native mobile support Get as close to write once, run anywhere as possible Without sacrificing quality Sustainable tools Ensure all tools use sound engineering practices Make sure there is either a stable following to a tool or an easy pivot High quality testing Stack should be designed to hold complexity well Regression tests should be simple and clear What I've tried so far&amp;hellip; Why not go with vanilla Flux? Using only the Flux tools given by Facebook seems like a no-brainer, but besides being extraneously verbose, you have to maintain, grow, and enforce the framework yourself.
Pros Pretty good assurance that it will not fall out of popularity and leave you stranded. Cons Verbose in a bad way Leaves a ton of tooling to the imagination I lot of ways to mess up Left to your own devices on isomorphism Fluxible A full featured flux framework from Yahoo.
Pros Isomorphic Lots of convenience functionality Yahoo backs it and they still are a large company Cons A touch magical Pretty large Still a bit verbose Reflux A minimalistic rethinking of Flux for the functional programming world.
Pros Simplicity Relatively small Easy to conceptualize and get started No dispatcher, it is built in Cons Not isomorphic Small bits of built in magic, make it less flexible Suggests creating stores that subscribe to other stores This could create hidden complexity layers deep Flummox Minimal isomorphic Flux.
Cons Readme says it will not be supported Pros Gave me the name of a framework the author likes better Redux Advertised as &amp;ldquo;Atomic Flux with hot reloading,&amp;rdquo; A minimalistic, isomorphic take on Flux that is bare bones but extensible.
Current Winner In spite of its small following and young API, the minimalistic approach only gets as far from the vanilla implementation of Flux as you want it to. This would make it relatively easy to pivot to another Flux implementation of maintain independantly.
Pros Minimalistic Extensible Isomorphic Hot reloads code Dispatcher optional, atomic by default Cons Pre-1.0 API likely to have breaking changes Smaller following May not be a winner Update Log 2015-06-17: Published 2015-08-14: Added note about Relay</p><div class="action has-text-right"><a href=/2015/06/17/isomorphic-react-flux-stack/ class="button is-primary">Read more</a></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></section><section class=section><div class=container><div class=columns><div class="column is-centered-tablet-portrait"><h1 class="title section-title">food</h1><h5 class="subtitle is-5 is-muted"></h5><div class=divider></div><div class=section><div class=container><div class=columns></div><div class=columns><div class="column is-4"><div class=box><figure class="image is-3by2"><a href=/2015/01/03/18-years-of-crohns-1-week-of-soylent-1-3/><img src=/images/default_summary_hu2be732aee21a2469ead3fe1f2df8caca_2088687_600x0_resize_q75_box.jpg alt></a></figure><h3 class="title is-5 refresh-summary-title">18 Years of Crohn's, 1 Week of Soylent 1.3</h3><p class=refresh-summary>Don&amp;rsquo;t get me wrong, I love food, but lately I have become afraid of it because everything I eat causes me pain. I spent the first few days figuring out how I want to flavor my soylent. I went through different peanut butter and chocolate combos until I decided to ditch the peanut butter, go for simple cocoa powder, and add sugar.
The difference in how I felt after soylent was immediately clear. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t perfect, but it was better. The pain I felt drinking it was very dull and almost unnoticeable. Because of this, I started drinking soylent almost exclusively without even setting out to.
When I notice the trend I got a little more serious about it. By the second day, the only pain I felt was when I applied pressure to the areas of my intestine that are affected by crohn&amp;rsquo;s. Coming from being in immense pain after every meal, I was ecstatic.
By day three or four, I was entirely pain free.** Now, this hardly constitutes a study and there are plenty of other variables that haven&amp;rsquo;t been isolated, but I&amp;rsquo;m going to call it a success so far. I upped my order of Soylent and it can&amp;rsquo;t arrive soon enough.

a corpse said to be revived by witchcraft, esp. in certain African and Caribbean religions.
Early religions lacked the scientific methods to explain everyday events and defaulted to labeling things that couldn&amp;rsquo;t otherwise be explained as witchcraft.
It is through that stretch of the definition of a zombie that allow the walkers on AMC&amp;rsquo;s The Walking Dead to be labeled zombies. Even though we know the walkers to be infected by a virus that seems to be fairly predictable, the same behavior in another culture would have been seen as witchcraft.

Why would I need to plan a tactical assault in a videogame before I know how to fire my gun?
Great, now lets jump back to user experience. Since I work on the web, lets use the web as an example. Not to single anything out, but Google Analytics is a complex platform that has had a long time to mature, lets use it as an example.
In Google Analytics, why would I want to benchmark my user’s location when I haven’t even been introduced to even the most basic vocabulary of the platform, like what’s a user, vs. a pageview, vs. a session.
Now okay, lets take a step back from the criticism. There is a nice youtube tutorial to help you figure things out, but people who surf the web are doers. If they see a complex interface in front of them, they don’t want to hold back and watch a video. They are going to press all the buttons until they figure it out.
What would I prefer? Less buttons. Give me a chart with simple pageviews. Once I get comfortable with a pageview, tell me “hey! I bet you are frustrated with returning users being counted as new pageviews. Guess what? We’ve got something for you, its called users. If you look at the number of users you’ll see unique visits to your website.
Sure that might mean that as a new user, I can’t track my acquisition campaigns. But what the hell is an acquisition campaign? Is someone buying me new websites?
Kidding aside, you can have complex mature platforms that don’t overwhelm users, it just takes a little extra effort.</p><div class="action has-text-right"><a href=/2014/11/15/ux-that-grows-complexity-with-the-user-not-the/ class="button is-primary">Read more</a></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></section><section class=section><div class=container><div class=columns><div class="column is-centered-tablet-portrait"><h1 class="title section-title">fun</h1><h5 class="subtitle is-5 is-muted"></h5><div class=divider></div><div class=section><div class=container><div class=columns></div><div class=columns><div class="column is-4"><div class=box><figure class="image is-3by2"><a href=/2015/06/03/minimalist-or-just-boring/><img src=/images/default_summary_hu2be732aee21a2469ead3fe1f2df8caca_2088687_600x0_resize_q75_box.jpg alt></a></figure><h3 class="title is-5 refresh-summary-title">Minimalist? or just boring?</h3><p class=refresh-summary>So a hatched a plan to spice it up with a blast from the past.

Distribute the square and it becomes πr^2 / 4r^2
Now the r^2 cancels leaving us with a constant!!
π / 4
What does that constant mean? Well if we were leaving the corners of our field for the poor, π / 4 is how much of our produce we would be taking home. So how much does that leave for charity?
1 - π / 4
Okay great, so I just need to give that much charity. So lets say Sally makes 60K a year after taxes, how much does she need to give to live up to the commandments?
(1 - π / 4) * $60,000 = $12,876.11
Also, I didn’t do the math, but you can probably knock ~1K off that because our government spends your tax money on social programs.</p><div class="action has-text-right"><a href=/2015/01/14/giving-1-4-of-your-wealth-to-charity/ class="button is-primary">Read more</a></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></section><section class=section><div class=container><div class=columns><div class="column is-centered-tablet-portrait"><h1 class="title section-title">golang</h1><h5 class="subtitle is-5 is-muted"></h5><div class=divider></div><div class=section><div class=container><div class=columns></div><div class=columns><div class="column is-4"><div class=box><figure class="image is-3by2"><a href=/2013/11/23/machine-learning-in-go/><img src=/images/default_summary_hu2be732aee21a2469ead3fe1f2df8caca_2088687_600x0_resize_q75_box.jpg alt></a></figure><h3 class="title is-5 refresh-summary-title">Machine Learning in Go</h3><p class=refresh-summary>For a while now I have been curious about Go. There doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem to be much to it, but it is getting more and more popular. Another itch I&amp;rsquo;ve had for a really long time is to write my own machine learning/AI framework. After looking at Golang a bit more, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t shake the feeling that it would be the perfect language for my machine learning framework.
I did some searching and while there were people talking about writing machine learning frameworks in Go, no one was actually doing it. There was some mention of having the science and mathematics packages built up before they implement machine learning because most of the papers are written using mathematical formulas that aren&amp;rsquo;t easy to implement.
This made me even more excited because I&amp;rsquo;m of the opinion that implementing research papers would deliver much less value than engineering the framework with research as an inspiration.
When will I be ready to release this framework? The truth is I don&amp;rsquo;t know, I just wanted to mention that it is in the works incase you stumble across a post I write about Go and wonder, what the heck does he know about Go?</p><div class="action has-text-right"><a href=/2013/11/23/machine-learning-in-go/ class="button is-primary">Read more</a></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></section><section class=section><div class=container><div class=columns><div class="column is-centered-tablet-portrait"><h1 class="title section-title">google</h1><h5 class="subtitle is-5 is-muted"></h5><div class=divider></div><div class=section><div class=container><div class=columns></div><div class=columns><div class="column is-4"><div class=box><figure class="image is-3by2"><a href=/2014/12/23/wishlist-google-calendar-trips/><img src=/images/default_summary_hu2be732aee21a2469ead3fe1f2df8caca_2088687_600x0_resize_q75_box.jpg alt></a></figure><h3 class="title is-5 refresh-summary-title">Wishlist: Google Calendar Trips</h3><p class=refresh-summary>Google calendar has many features I rely on, one of my favorites is the integration with Google now that helps you get where you need to go on time.

The only way I can see myself doing that is if I were provided a web based programming experience that was better than coding on metal.
Enter Bryan&amp;rsquo;s fantasy world, where a flourishing space economy affords us with cheap vacations to the moon and once a year visits to grandma on the mars colony. Err&amp;hellip; I mean where there is a really cool way to work on code in the cloud.
I started my version of this in 2012 in meteorjs, I called the project meteorite (everyone who knows meteor is laughing at me right now). It was a very primitive project where you start a meteor server and others could load it up and collaborate on changes that synced to your filesystem.
I recently started giving it a once over to see if I could get it up to snuff for my recent ideas on tightening the communication gap in something like a git workflow.
As I pulled the open source threads I found many projects from a github account by the name of mad-eye useful. After I quick search, I realized it was because they were doing exactly what I was trying to do.
I was about to abandon the idea when I thought about how receptive my company is to feedback and suggestions from customers. So here it is, my first of what will hopefully be many wishlists.
Wishlist
A single source of truth that my whole team can work on simultaneously The ability for each team member to live check out a version of the codebase that has either been vetted or written by that member The ability to live check out a version of the codebase that has been vetted by every member of the team (for production) The ability to accept changes made by team members and see who has accepted which pieces of code This would mean turning most people&amp;rsquo;s git workflows inside out. Instead of patches and commits going into a central repository when a consensus is reached on their quality, they make their way from a central source of truth out to each individual&amp;rsquo;s server where they run their own version of the code with code that excludes code they have not yet accepted.
Not only would this eliminate merge conflicts
It would improve communication and make modeling complex problems a much more fluid team experience akin to working on a structure in minecraft.
Since I will probably never get around to doing this on my own, I figured I would share my two cents. Hope it makes your roadmap :-)</p><div class="action has-text-right"><a href=/2014/07/28/wishlist-coding-in-the-cloud-without-falling/ class="button is-primary">Read more</a></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></section><section class=section><div class=container><div class=columns><div class="column is-centered-tablet-portrait"><h1 class="title section-title">graphiql</h1><h5 class="subtitle is-5 is-muted"></h5><div class=divider></div><div class=section><div class=container><div class=columns></div><div class=columns><div class="column is-4"><div class=box><figure class="image is-3by2"><a href=/2015/12/19/graphiql-bookmarklet/><img src=/images/default_summary_hu2be732aee21a2469ead3fe1f2df8caca_2088687_600x0_resize_q75_box.jpg alt></a></figure><h3 class="title is-5 refresh-summary-title">GraphiQL Bookmarklet</h3><p class=refresh-summary>I'm sure most of you, if you have done any work with graphql, have heard of graphiql.

Why am I stating the obvious? Well, it is quite simply to emphasize just how important it is where we draw those lines.
To illustrate this, lets start all the way on the left side of the machine instruction / common understanding spectrum. By that I mean a simple procedural program. This program needs to do a list of technological things. For instance, it needs to take input, process the input and react to it, displaying some output.
As my list of instructions grows, my understandability shrinks. But I'm a software engineer, I can fix this! If we just split up our code into separate responsabilities, the complexity is managed.
So now we have a place to put code that handles input, a place to put code that handles business logic and a place to format my output. However, the complexity of our code is not done growing. We now have different types of input, more rules to apply to process the input, and multiple ways of displaying the same input. But I'm a software engineer, I can fix this.
Lets get more specific about responsabilities, we can split the input set and handle different kinds of input in different places, some of our business logic does one thing to our data while other business logic does another thing, we can split that up, and we can create decorators for all the ways we need to display our state!
After all that complexity management, I think it is time to meet with the client and show them how cool their app is going to be. Enter client&amp;hellip; &amp;lsquo;wow, great work you guys, I hope it isn't a problem that we are thinking about changing widgets to have round tuits and respond to thingy mabobers.&amp;rsquo;
Now we realize our mistake. We've been so busy putting everything in our neat little piles, we didn't realize that the imaginary lines we've been drawing to do it were around concepts completely tangential to our domain. Meaning, in order to change a concept, we need to change it in 40 places neatly hidden by gems that magically composes services so you don't have to think about them. By the time we are done tracking down the things we need to change, we better cross our fingers and hope it all still works (Or run our test suit that grows exponentially in size).
So we've learned our lesson, what do we do differently next time? How do we avoid the same mistake? The answer to that is quite simple, draw your imaginary lines along your domain, rather than your technologies.
What does that mean in the real world?
Well having a product component in react that has the styles declared right under the react component and the required data declared just under that in a relay container follows this principle
However, a controller that processes a request for a product in a separate file from a model that does logic for the product and another file that displays the product and another file that adds a layer on top of the product for another display, does not follow this principle.</p><div class="action has-text-right"><a href=/2016/04/01/imaginary-lines/ class="button is-primary">Read more</a></div></div></div><div class="column is-4"><div class=box><figure class="image is-3by2"><a href=/2015/12/19/graphiql-bookmarklet/><img src=/images/default_summary_hu2be732aee21a2469ead3fe1f2df8caca_2088687_600x0_resize_q75_box.jpg alt></a></figure><h3 class="title is-5 refresh-summary-title">GraphiQL Bookmarklet</h3><p class=refresh-summary>I'm sure most of you, if you have done any work with graphql, have heard of graphiql.

Have a look.
I want to tell you in as few words as possible why I am so excited to get my hands on Relay and GraphQL.
React is widely popular because it is simple and declarative, making it very deterministic and easy to work with. React is also fully composable, making it imensly powerful with high potential for writing reusable code.
Relay is a mirror image of React, except instead of composing beautiful views for the web and native mobile devices using JSX, you can compose data from your database for your views using graphql.

On the web, that means using Heroku, but with a react native app it is a bit more complicated.
My react native app has two components, the packager (for serving the client code) and the server (for interacting with the app).
Heroku only lets one process bind to an external port, so it wasn't easy to do without creating two heroku apps.
My solution was to proxy the bundle from the server, the problem with this, is that if the packager is running in a worker, it can't be reached over localhost.
The packager is launched via a shell script, and by opening it, I can see what javascript file is being run. All I had to do was require the packager in my server (yes I know I could just use a node child process, but this is cooler).
My server uses websockets, so this is how I added the proxy&amp;hellip;
You will see that I also added react-native-env and made an environment.plist ala this blog post with a hostname so that my application will know which server to use.
To change environments I just swap out the environment.plist with one that has a different hostname.</p><div class="action has-text-right"><a href=/2015/07/26/react-native-on-heroku/ class="button is-primary">Read more</a></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></section><section class=section><div class=container><div class=columns><div class="column is-centered-tablet-portrait"><h1 class="title section-title">html5</h1><h5 class="subtitle is-5 is-muted"></h5><div class=divider></div><div class=section><div class=container><div class=columns></div><div class=columns><div class="column is-4"><div class=box><figure class="image is-3by2"><a href=/2015/06/25/under-construction/><img src=/images/default_summary_hu2be732aee21a2469ead3fe1f2df8caca_2088687_600x0_resize_q75_box.jpg alt></a></figure><h3 class="title is-5 refresh-summary-title">Bringing back 'Under Construction' in style</h3><p class=refresh-summary>I'm just going to go ahead and say what's on everyone's mind already.

&amp;ldquo;Of, relating to, or conforming to idiom&amp;rdquo; - Merriam-Webster
So what is an idiom?
&amp;ldquo;The syntactical, grammatical, or structural form peculiar to a language&amp;rdquo; - Merriam-Webster
When we talk about idiomatic programming, we are talking about doing things because it is &amp;ldquo;the way&amp;rdquo; to do them, or because so-and-so says this is a rule that can’t be broken.
Why is it important to see past these idioms and understand why they are &amp;ldquo;the way?&amp;rdquo;
Just to be clear, it is not my intent to prove that you shouldn’t follow these idioms. In fact, I think you should follow them, but remember to &amp;ldquo;know before you go.&amp;rdquo; To convince you, I will try and reject the hypothesis that &amp;ldquo;you should always follow the best idioms regardless of the situation.&amp;rdquo;
Let me take as my example, the golden rule. For those of you that don’t know, the golden rule is something us Americans are taught in preschool that usually is somewhere along the lines of &amp;ldquo;do unto others as you would have them do unto you.&amp;rdquo; I think we can all agree that it is a pretty good rule to follow. In order to reject my hypothesis, I just need to find a situation where this is not the right thing to do. Does this mean that I am a bad person, or that I think any less of whomever came up with the golden rule? No.
Now, let's say you have a cabin in the woods. I’m not talking up in Westchester, I’m talking Canadian wilderness area. Someone comes across your property, and they are obviously lost, probably hungry, cold and tired. You are like really into the golden rule, super idiomatic, and a very nice person. You invite them in, offer them food, share your fire, and even let them use your radio to call into town. This is a great scenario for both people, new friendships are made, a life is potentially saved. Now let's make a slight adjustment.
What if you were a masochist? That is, someone who likes inflicting pain on themselves. It isn’t all that uncommon. A child goes through repeated, traumatic, painful experiences, and grows up taking pleasure in the feeling of pain. Now you are that child all grown up, have that same cabin in the woods, and are super idiomatic about the golden rule. What do you think you will do with this visitor?
I'm not going to continue because I think it is safe to say the hypothesis has been rejected.
So instead of being idiomatic, you can realize that even the most thoughtful and skilled individual can’t think of every possible situation in which their words can be applied.

All you have to do is make a code migration with the option moduleApiChange: true. Then just instruct all your faithful to run jscodemigrate deps to copy your code migration into their codemods folder so they can have it run with their code migrations.

Changing standards and updated api's left code fragmented as the codebase grew.
From the time I started working on coffeelint, the problem has been stewing in my head. Subconciously on the lookout for a solution, I heard about codemods. Let me preface by saying I've been quite obsessed with everything facebook engineering has been doing in open source lately. Needless to say I took notice.
I tried to jump in to the game but after playing around with jscodeshift in the super nifty ast explorer I noticed there was a peice missing. Only this time, a mortal human like myself could fill it.
We have been told that facebook has a codemod runner and I have no doubt that there is a bit of process in place governing it. But outside of facebook, we only have a one off runner that is hard to work into a team's process.
Inspired by my desire to solve this problem and an admiration for the way rails handles database migrations I decided to build a code migration tool that wraps jscodeshift. It might be a little rough, since it is hot off the vim, but I'm eager to hear what people think about the concept.

The reason for the switch is not what I'm writing to discuss, but I'll just say that the unpredictability of mongodb was starting to become an issue in development. The thought was that if it was already difficult before the data starts pouring in, it will probably be a nightmare one the product is in use. And that meant switching from graffiti-mongoose, to my own graphql database glue.
I searched for an ORM that could take the place of mongoose and it wasn't long before I stumbled upon BookshelfJS. Built alongside its query building counterpart by @tgriesser, it was a good choice of where to start.
Then I had a choice, I could build a graffiti adapter for postgres, but I wanted something more lightweight than graffiti. My graphql schema were more akin to controllers than database models, so the idea of having them exclusively tied to models didn't feel right. I needed custom attributes that were not on my models to be in my graphql schema.
Instead of building a larger solution, I collected helper methods every time I needed to do something related to accessing the bookshelf model. I ended up with a bunch of neat little wrappers to help with bookshelf graphql schema and I spent yesterday putting it together with some tests and documentation to open source.

Enjoy!
Footnote &amp;ndash; I haven't played around with Relay enough yet to know if this will work with connection types, but it will almost certainly work for plain old graphql schema.</p><div class="action has-text-right"><a href=/2015/08/13/graphql-bookshelf/ class="button is-primary">Read more</a></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></section><section class=section><div class=container><div class=columns><div class="column is-centered-tablet-portrait"><h1 class="title section-title">lifestyle</h1><h5 class="subtitle is-5 is-muted"></h5><div class=divider></div><div class=section><div class=container><div class=columns></div><div class=columns><div class="column is-4"><div class=box><figure class="image is-3by2"><a href=/post/2020-04-05-quarantine-workout/><img src=/images/default_summary_hu2be732aee21a2469ead3fe1f2df8caca_2088687_600x0_resize_q75_box.jpg alt></a></figure><h3 class="title is-5 refresh-summary-title">Quarantine Rule #1: Exercise every day</h3><p class=refresh-summary>It may sound like a lot, but if you are like me and your quarantine space is limited to a studio apartment, then it is probably the most essential thing you can do to stay sane. The three groups of exercise I alternate between are:
Anaerobic Aerobic Stretching As an experienced introvert, it may not come as a surprise to you that exercise is one of the things I tend to go long periods neglecting, but in this new COVID-19 world, I decided it was mission critical so I went on a YouTube research quest to figure out what I was going to do for exercise.
My goals on this quest were to get a good anaerobic workout that didn’t take too much time or require any special equipment. After devising my super sophisticated research plan, I typed “workout” into youtube and started scrolling through the results. My hypothesis was that if I wanted to get a good workout, I need to find someone who has a similar body type to me. This means that as much as I wanted to get my workout information from the attractive young lady, I chose a video by a smallish frame asian dude who’s muscles I could imagine wearing.
Since the goal of this blogpost isn’t to endorse my youtube workout coach I will not post a link, but I did like the video very much because it explained the reasoning behind all the workout decisions and talked about how many reps you should do in terms of how many you can do rather than giving a specific number. Also, because the trainer was targeting COVID watchers, the only equipment I needed for this workout was two sheets with a knot tied to hang over the door.
The video recommends only doing the workout every other day, but I need to work out every day for my sanity, this means I need some kind of an aerobic workout. Now, my usual solution would be to play music and jump around until I’m sweaty, but I noticed this was too time consuming as it would take me awhile to get tired. I also noticed that sitting at a desk for a long time was making me feel lousy.
This is when I decided to buy a mini elliptical to put under my improvised standing desk. This way I can work while doing my aerobics so it is okay if it takes a bit longer. This has a small impact on shower planning, but I am confident you can figure that out.
Finally, after a week of alternating between full body and aerobic workouts, you may find at the end of the week that you are just exhausted and can’t do it anymore. At least, that is what happened to me. That is when I decided to designate a stretching day. Stretching day came when my muscles were just not willing to do another workout. On stretching day, I went on YouTube and searched for stretches for the parts of my body that ached and after watching a flamboyant doctor tell me all the ways I should bend to loosen the muscles that were tight, I felt a lot better.
Hopefully walking you through my experience with exercising in quarantine will give you the motivation you need to get YouTube fired up and do some exercising yourself. Stay tuned for the rest of my quarantutorials.</p><div class="action has-text-right"><a href=/post/2020-04-05-quarantine-workout/ class="button is-primary">Read more</a></div></div></div><div class="column is-4"><div class=box><figure class="image is-3by2"><a href=/post/2020-04-05-quarantine-life/><img src=/images/default_summary_hu2be732aee21a2469ead3fe1f2df8caca_2088687_600x0_resize_q75_box.jpg alt></a></figure><h3 class="title is-5 refresh-summary-title">Quarantine Tips from Experienced Introvert</h3><p class=refresh-summary>The year is 2003.

The temptation is strong, but the draw of my new computer that I had been obsessing over is even stronger.
Fast-forward to 2020. COVID-19 terrorizes the world and we are all forced to quarantine until god knows when. That temptation to go outside and play, to socialize and do things in person is gone. Now suddenly that world that I've been so drawn to my entire life is the world everyone else is suddenly living in.

Feel free to use the host of your choosing, or host your own box if that’s your cup of tea.
I set up an ubuntu box with a ruby on rails dev environment. The only thing that I had to set up out of the ordinary was XVFB. This is because I have browser tests that run and need an X server even though it is headless. One snag with this, after you get XVFB running, don’t forget to tell your application which display to connect to (for me it was setting the $DISPLAY environment variable).
JuiceSSH On my Nexus 9, I chose JuiceSSH as my SSH client since it has a nice UI and makes ssh tunneling easy.
First I set up a normal connection to my Linode server, follow the instructions that linode gives you.
Next you need to tunnel your dev server port. JuiceSSH makes this easy, just go to your connections and swipe left. Then you will be able to access the dev server of your website from your android.
External Keyboard Helper Pro You will need a bluetooth keyboard of your choosing, the keyboard case is good if you are on the go, but I am much more comfortable on a slightly larger keyboard.
Like many developers, there is at least one key on the keyboard you will need to remap. That key is caps lock. Since all developer’s know caps lock is supposed to be control, this one is a no brainer.
This is pretty easy to do.
On the keyboard case for the Nexus 9, it is a search button. I haven’t found a way to remap it yet, but if you are able to I’d love to hear from you.
What’s missing? Chrome Inspector Remote Chrome Inspecting works fine if you are trying to debug a phone, but what if you are making your tablet a dev environment? There needs to be a better way to inspect a page from a tablet.
Remapping Search Key =&amp;gt; Control This one is just silly. I can remap any key with External Keyboard Helper Pro, but the search key is above it. It has some super powers that make it refuse to be remapped.</p><div class="action has-text-right"><a href=/2015/03/11/web-development-on-a-nexus-9/ class="button is-primary">Read more</a></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></section><section class=section><div class=container><div class=columns><div class="column is-centered-tablet-portrait"><h1 class="title section-title">linux</h1><h5 class="subtitle is-5 is-muted"></h5><div class=divider></div><div class=section><div class=container><div class=columns></div><div class=columns><div class="column is-4"><div class=box><figure class="image is-3by2"><a href=/post/2017-11-06-job-of-os/><img src=/images/default_summary_hu2be732aee21a2469ead3fe1f2df8caca_2088687_600x0_resize_q75_box.jpg alt></a></figure><h3 class="title is-5 refresh-summary-title">The Job of an OS</h3><p class=refresh-summary>It started with a gitter chat then a tweet, followed by a blog post.
&amp;hellip;
Well, I've had some time to digest my thoughts, and I think it is time for, a second blog post.
Whenever I think something needs redefining, the first thing I like to do is look for a definition (shocking right?). The Merriam-Webster dictionary defines and Operating System as:
Software that controls the operation of a computer and directs the processing of programs (as by assigning storage space in memory and controlling input and output functions)
The problem with this definition is that it is too anchored in the challenges of early computing that involved managing the hardware nuances of different machines and creating a predictable environment in which to work at a higher level.
Fast forward a few decades, and we are living in a world where the challenges of computing, solved each in a separate way, are taming the unique complexities of different devices for the purpose of operating different classes of predictable environments for different types of users.
We spread the gospel of Linux, because it has done so much to advance the state of operating systems and put everyone on the same page when it comes to bringing systems from a hardware level, into the world of software. But companies like Apple, Google, and Samsung build different layers of systems on top of unix/linux. Are these systems not also &amp;ldquo;operating systems?&amp;rdquo; Does a system really have to be dealing in bits to be called an operating system?
If you really do need to be managing a physical computer to be an operating, what does an OS become when it is on a virtual machine? It clearly has a purpose since we use virtual machines all the time, but it isn't an operating system by our old definition, it is in fact, a brilliant hack.
Here is an even more controversial one, is a desktop manager like GNOME or KDE an operating system? I would argue that it is. When you hear my definition of an operating system, you will understand why. In my mind, an Operating System is:
A collection of components that work together atop a general purpose machine to make a consistent interface that is more conducive to a particular purpose.
You may be wondering why I care so much about what constitutes an OS. The answer is pretty simple. If we redefine an OS like this, an OS gains a property that I believe to be essential to the challenges of computing that lie ahead.
Operating Systems become composable.
Composability is a very important topic in software engineering. In fact, it is a major component of the Unix philosophy that embodies the spirit of most of the successful operating systems in use today.
As the number of different devices grows, so will the number of things we do with those devices. In the same vein, the things we do with those devices, we will inherently want to be able to reproduce on other devices, from slight changes in marketed products, to full on simulations in different environments.
Moving our definition of an Operating System away from the metal, will allow us to define clear, standard interfaces that our operating systems provide along with clear, standard interfaces that our operating systems consume. The technology world will benefit greatly if we put an end to hacking together virtual machines, container solutions, and Operating Systems built on stripped down modified versions of other operating systems.

Let me clarify, when I am running linux in a container to build applications the operating system should not be bothering me with arbitrary user systems.
When was the last time you logged into a multi-user unix system that had other users on it? Was it in your CS department in college? Me too.
We don't share computers anymore, even toddlers get their own phones with more computing power than you had in your desktop when Linux was born. Not only do we not share computers, it is actually the opposite, computers share us. Many companies have figured that out by now, using the &amp;ldquo;cloud&amp;rdquo; to build multi computer operating systems.
So I say no one is actually leveraging multi user linux systems in a way that is intuitive, and you say, well what about enterprise and large institutions. Well, if they are managing servers that multiple people log into, they should probably think about modernizing the way they orchestrate their systems.
Let me explain what I mean, and to do so I will divide up the uses of Linux into two categories.
Running a remote service for people to use. Running a local machine for someone to use. When solving for the first, you might say, &amp;ldquo;I want all my users to log in and have complete access to a unix environment.&amp;rdquo; To that, I would ask &amp;ldquo;Do you really need a whole unix environment to use service, or can you build a more direct interface?&amp;rdquo; If the answer is you need a unix environment, I would say, you should build containers for your users and log them into containers. However, the answer is much more likely to be no, we just need our users to check their email, to which I would say, you probably just want to run an email service and have it communicate with some central authorization service. To that you might say, &amp;ldquo;That is exactly what I'll do, except I'll just use unix permissions for my authorization because it is there.&amp;rdquo; To that I would ask, &amp;ldquo;Do you really want your service authorization coupled to your computer operating system?&amp;rdquo; Operating systems are made to run hardware to the point where it becomes a generic, pluggable system to run software. What if you got new hardware that was better, but required a different operating system, do you want to port your authorization to the new system? A better way to solve this problem, would be to look for a solid, system independent authorization module and use that.
Now how about the second use case? This takes us back to the fact that we no longer share computers, and if we did, it wouldn't be the responsibility of the computer operating system to manage this, it would be a service on top. Let's look at android for instance, now I will admit I don't know a whole lot about how the internals relate to linux, but I do know what the security focus has been on, and it hasn't been user level security, it has been app level. Users install software from a plethora of sources, and they don't fully understand the consequences of doing so. A system like android has built authorization and sandboxing around each application, giving it permission to access only what it needs to do the job it has. That isn't to say that android doesn't leverage the multi-user nature of linux, but it certainly doesn't need to, and it doesn't exactly fit cleanly into the paradigm of multi-system users that it is building for.
I am happy to have a discussion about this (maybe it already exists), but I would love to see a version of linux that did away with multiple users and instead focused on app level security.

Look for all the individual places the pattern changed. Check to see that a few of them make sense. Observe how they differ, and maybe search through the code independently looking for parts that may have been missed or intentionally left out. If you find inconsistencies comment and ask about them.
If you agree with the pattern change and you look through them and they all look good, then all you need to do is go through the rest of your normal PR checklist and you’re good to approve it.
If you don’t agree with the pattern change in general, comment on where the pattern could do better. Maybe there is a reason the pattern isn’t that way.
Large feature added If there is a new feature, the first thing to check after you know you want the feature, is all the points where the new code touches existing code. If you find out how it interfaces you can box it in your mind and it will be less overwhelming.
Are the interfaces with the rest of your code standard? Is the new code structured in a way that is consistent with all of your patterns? Is the new code tested? Is the new code integration tested with the rest of the system?
Briefly read through the implementation and check for any faulty assumptions about the existing code. If you find faulty assumptions, point them out so the new feature can be fixed. If you start having common assumptions about different parts of your code that are off, that is a code smell and you should probably address it.
Once you’ve asked all the questions and read through the code, have someone else look at it and then sign off.

There doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem to be much to it, but it is getting more and more popular. Another itch I&amp;rsquo;ve had for a really long time is to write my own machine learning/AI framework. After looking at Golang a bit more, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t shake the feeling that it would be the perfect language for my machine learning framework.
I did some searching and while there were people talking about writing machine learning frameworks in Go, no one was actually doing it. There was some mention of having the science and mathematics packages built up before they implement machine learning because most of the papers are written using mathematical formulas that aren&amp;rsquo;t easy to implement.
This made me even more excited because I&amp;rsquo;m of the opinion that implementing research papers would deliver much less value than engineering the framework with research as an inspiration.
When will I be ready to release this framework? The truth is I don&amp;rsquo;t know, I just wanted to mention that it is in the works incase you stumble across a post I write about Go and wonder, what the heck does he know about Go?</p><div class="action has-text-right"><a href=/2013/11/23/machine-learning-in-go/ class="button is-primary">Read more</a></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></section><section class=section><div class=container><div class=columns><div class="column is-centered-tablet-portrait"><h1 class="title section-title">mad-eye</h1><h5 class="subtitle is-5 is-muted"></h5><div class=divider></div><div class=section><div class=container><div class=columns></div><div class=columns><div class="column is-4"><div class=box><figure class="image is-3by2"><a href=/2014/07/28/wishlist-coding-in-the-cloud-without-falling/><img src=/images/default_summary_hu2be732aee21a2469ead3fe1f2df8caca_2088687_600x0_resize_q75_box.jpg alt></a></figure><h3 class="title is-5 refresh-summary-title">Wishlist: Coding in the Cloud (without falling from the sky)</h3><p class=refresh-summary>As a diehard Google fanboy, it is my duty to figure out how I can switch to a Chromebook as my primary laptop. The only way I can see myself doing that is if I were provided a web based programming experience that was better than coding on metal.
Enter Bryan&amp;rsquo;s fantasy world, where a flourishing space economy affords us with cheap vacations to the moon and once a year visits to grandma on the mars colony. Err&amp;hellip; I mean where there is a really cool way to work on code in the cloud.
I started my version of this in 2012 in meteorjs, I called the project meteorite (everyone who knows meteor is laughing at me right now). It was a very primitive project where you start a meteor server and others could load it up and collaborate on changes that synced to your filesystem.
I recently started giving it a once over to see if I could get it up to snuff for my recent ideas on tightening the communication gap in something like a git workflow.
As I pulled the open source threads I found many projects from a github account by the name of mad-eye useful. After I quick search, I realized it was because they were doing exactly what I was trying to do.
I was about to abandon the idea when I thought about how receptive my company is to feedback and suggestions from customers. So here it is, my first of what will hopefully be many wishlists.
Wishlist
A single source of truth that my whole team can work on simultaneously The ability for each team member to live check out a version of the codebase that has either been vetted or written by that member The ability to live check out a version of the codebase that has been vetted by every member of the team (for production) The ability to accept changes made by team members and see who has accepted which pieces of code This would mean turning most people&amp;rsquo;s git workflows inside out. Instead of patches and commits going into a central repository when a consensus is reached on their quality, they make their way from a central source of truth out to each individual&amp;rsquo;s server where they run their own version of the code with code that excludes code they have not yet accepted.
Not only would this eliminate merge conflicts
It would improve communication and make modeling complex problems a much more fluid team experience akin to working on a structure in minecraft.
Since I will probably never get around to doing this on my own, I figured I would share my two cents. Hope it makes your roadmap :-)</p><div class="action has-text-right"><a href=/2014/07/28/wishlist-coding-in-the-cloud-without-falling/ class="button is-primary">Read more</a></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></section><section class=section><div class=container><div class=columns><div class="column is-centered-tablet-portrait"><h1 class="title section-title">marquee</h1><h5 class="subtitle is-5 is-muted"></h5><div class=divider></div><div class=section><div class=container><div class=columns></div><div class=columns><div class="column is-4"><div class=box><figure class="image is-3by2"><a href=/2015/06/25/under-construction/><img src=/images/default_summary_hu2be732aee21a2469ead3fe1f2df8caca_2088687_600x0_resize_q75_box.jpg alt></a></figure><h3 class="title is-5 refresh-summary-title">Bringing back 'Under Construction' in style</h3><p class=refresh-summary>I'm just going to go ahead and say what's on everyone's mind already.

Now the ratio is πr^2 / (2r)^2
Distribute the square and it becomes πr^2 / 4r^2
Now the r^2 cancels leaving us with a constant!!
π / 4
What does that constant mean? Well if we were leaving the corners of our field for the poor, π / 4 is how much of our produce we would be taking home. So how much does that leave for charity?
1 - π / 4
Okay great, so I just need to give that much charity. So lets say Sally makes 60K a year after taxes, how much does she need to give to live up to the commandments?
(1 - π / 4) * $60,000 = $12,876.11
Also, I didn’t do the math, but you can probably knock ~1K off that because our government spends your tax money on social programs.</p><div class="action has-text-right"><a href=/2015/01/14/giving-1-4-of-your-wealth-to-charity/ class="button is-primary">Read more</a></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></section><section class=section><div class=container><div class=columns><div class="column is-centered-tablet-portrait"><h1 class="title section-title">meteorjs</h1><h5 class="subtitle is-5 is-muted"></h5><div class=divider></div><div class=section><div class=container><div class=columns></div><div class=columns><div class="column is-4"><div class=box><figure class="image is-3by2"><a href=/2014/12/04/voltrb-first-impressions/><img src=/images/default_summary_hu2be732aee21a2469ead3fe1f2df8caca_2088687_600x0_resize_q75_box.jpg alt></a></figure><h3 class="title is-5 refresh-summary-title">Voltrb first impressions</h3><p class=refresh-summary>Also, opal compiles my ruby to JavaScript, but I don’t notice any of it.

You already know that you can run all of your jscodeshift scripts at once and easily maintain your project with a directory full of timestamped codemods, but now, you can make it easy for those who depend on your npm packages to respond quickly to your API changes.
All you have to do is make a code migration with the option moduleApiChange: true. Then just instruct all your faithful to run jscodemigrate deps to copy your code migration into their codemods folder so they can have it run with their code migrations.

Changing standards and updated api's left code fragmented as the codebase grew.
From the time I started working on coffeelint, the problem has been stewing in my head. Subconciously on the lookout for a solution, I heard about codemods. Let me preface by saying I've been quite obsessed with everything facebook engineering has been doing in open source lately. Needless to say I took notice.
I tried to jump in to the game but after playing around with jscodeshift in the super nifty ast explorer I noticed there was a peice missing. Only this time, a mortal human like myself could fill it.
We have been told that facebook has a codemod runner and I have no doubt that there is a bit of process in place governing it. But outside of facebook, we only have a one off runner that is hard to work into a team's process.
Inspired by my desire to solve this problem and an admiration for the way rails handles database migrations I decided to build a code migration tool that wraps jscodeshift. It might be a little rough, since it is hot off the vim, but I'm eager to hear what people think about the concept.

Of course this solution goes downhill if ISPs team up on their evil ways, but that would be a good reason to declare them an actual monopoly and bust them up.</p><div class="action has-text-right"><a href=/2013/11/09/monopolistic-isps/ class="button is-primary">Read more</a></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></section><section class=section><div class=container><div class=columns><div class="column is-centered-tablet-portrait"><h1 class="title section-title">new years</h1><h5 class="subtitle is-5 is-muted"></h5><div class=divider></div><div class=section><div class=container><div class=columns></div><div class=columns><div class="column is-4"><div class=box><figure class="image is-3by2"><a href=/2015/01/09/the-seesaw-first-five-days/><img src=/images/default_summary_hu2be732aee21a2469ead3fe1f2df8caca_2088687_600x0_resize_q75_box.jpg alt></a></figure><h3 class="title is-5 refresh-summary-title">The Seesaw First Five Days</h3><p class=refresh-summary>The Seesaw First Five Daysfrancinegoldsteinmarketblog:
January 8, 2015
Happy new year! Volatility is alive and well!
Let’s recap the first five days: the S&amp;amp;P 500 Index sold off 2.7% for the first three days and then surged 3.0% for the next two days.
The sharp stock market volatility has proved especially challenging for all but the nimblest&amp;hellip;
Thanks for the advice, seems like a fairly low risk / low maintenance way to maintain a portfolio. I can&amp;rsquo;t wait to start investing, I just hope I don&amp;rsquo;t have to learn things the hard way.
Also, as a nimble programmer, I would love to take advantage of the volatility. How does one get into automated trading?</p><div class="action has-text-right"><a href=/2015/01/09/the-seesaw-first-five-days/ class="button is-primary">Read more</a></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></section><section class=section><div class=container><div class=columns><div class="column is-centered-tablet-portrait"><h1 class="title section-title">nexus 9</h1><h5 class="subtitle is-5 is-muted"></h5><div class=divider></div><div class=section><div class=container><div class=columns></div><div class=columns><div class="column is-4"><div class=box><figure class="image is-3by2"><a href=/2015/03/11/web-development-on-a-nexus-9/><img src=/images/default_summary_hu2be732aee21a2469ead3fe1f2df8caca_2088687_600x0_resize_q75_box.jpg alt></a></figure><h3 class="title is-5 refresh-summary-title">Web Development on a Nexus 9</h3><p class=refresh-summary>Linode I tried a few AWS boxes at first, but in the end I wound up choosing Linode. Feel free to use the host of your choosing, or host your own box if that’s your cup of tea.
I set up an ubuntu box with a ruby on rails dev environment. The only thing that I had to set up out of the ordinary was XVFB. This is because I have browser tests that run and need an X server even though it is headless. One snag with this, after you get XVFB running, don’t forget to tell your application which display to connect to (for me it was setting the $DISPLAY environment variable).
JuiceSSH On my Nexus 9, I chose JuiceSSH as my SSH client since it has a nice UI and makes ssh tunneling easy.
First I set up a normal connection to my Linode server, follow the instructions that linode gives you.
Next you need to tunnel your dev server port. JuiceSSH makes this easy, just go to your connections and swipe left. Then you will be able to access the dev server of your website from your android.
External Keyboard Helper Pro You will need a bluetooth keyboard of your choosing, the keyboard case is good if you are on the go, but I am much more comfortable on a slightly larger keyboard.
Like many developers, there is at least one key on the keyboard you will need to remap. That key is caps lock. Since all developer’s know caps lock is supposed to be control, this one is a no brainer.
This is pretty easy to do.
On the keyboard case for the Nexus 9, it is a search button. I haven’t found a way to remap it yet, but if you are able to I’d love to hear from you.
What’s missing? Chrome Inspector Remote Chrome Inspecting works fine if you are trying to debug a phone, but what if you are making your tablet a dev environment? There needs to be a better way to inspect a page from a tablet.
Remapping Search Key =&amp;gt; Control This one is just silly. I can remap any key with External Keyboard Helper Pro, but the search key is above it. It has some super powers that make it refuse to be remapped.</p><div class="action has-text-right"><a href=/2015/03/11/web-development-on-a-nexus-9/ class="button is-primary">Read more</a></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></section><section class=section><div class=container><div class=columns><div class="column is-centered-tablet-portrait"><h1 class="title section-title">nitrous</h1><h5 class="subtitle is-5 is-muted"></h5><div class=divider></div><div class=section><div class=container><div class=columns></div><div class=columns><div class="column is-4"><div class=box><figure class="image is-3by2"><a href=/2014/07/28/wishlist-coding-in-the-cloud-without-falling/><img src=/images/default_summary_hu2be732aee21a2469ead3fe1f2df8caca_2088687_600x0_resize_q75_box.jpg alt></a></figure><h3 class="title is-5 refresh-summary-title">Wishlist: Coding in the Cloud (without falling from the sky)</h3><p class=refresh-summary>As a diehard Google fanboy, it is my duty to figure out how I can switch to a Chromebook as my primary laptop. The only way I can see myself doing that is if I were provided a web based programming experience that was better than coding on metal.
Enter Bryan&amp;rsquo;s fantasy world, where a flourishing space economy affords us with cheap vacations to the moon and once a year visits to grandma on the mars colony. Err&amp;hellip; I mean where there is a really cool way to work on code in the cloud.
I started my version of this in 2012 in meteorjs, I called the project meteorite (everyone who knows meteor is laughing at me right now). It was a very primitive project where you start a meteor server and others could load it up and collaborate on changes that synced to your filesystem.
I recently started giving it a once over to see if I could get it up to snuff for my recent ideas on tightening the communication gap in something like a git workflow.
As I pulled the open source threads I found many projects from a github account by the name of mad-eye useful. After I quick search, I realized it was because they were doing exactly what I was trying to do.
I was about to abandon the idea when I thought about how receptive my company is to feedback and suggestions from customers. So here it is, my first of what will hopefully be many wishlists.
Wishlist
A single source of truth that my whole team can work on simultaneously The ability for each team member to live check out a version of the codebase that has either been vetted or written by that member The ability to live check out a version of the codebase that has been vetted by every member of the team (for production) The ability to accept changes made by team members and see who has accepted which pieces of code This would mean turning most people&amp;rsquo;s git workflows inside out. Instead of patches and commits going into a central repository when a consensus is reached on their quality, they make their way from a central source of truth out to each individual&amp;rsquo;s server where they run their own version of the code with code that excludes code they have not yet accepted.
Not only would this eliminate merge conflicts
It would improve communication and make modeling complex problems a much more fluid team experience akin to working on a structure in minecraft.
Since I will probably never get around to doing this on my own, I figured I would share my two cents. Hope it makes your roadmap :-)</p><div class="action has-text-right"><a href=/2014/07/28/wishlist-coding-in-the-cloud-without-falling/ class="button is-primary">Read more</a></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></section><section class=section><div class=container><div class=columns><div class="column is-centered-tablet-portrait"><h1 class="title section-title">nodejs</h1><h5 class="subtitle is-5 is-muted"></h5><div class=divider></div><div class=section><div class=container><div class=columns></div><div class=columns><div class="column is-4"><div class=box><figure class="image is-3by2"><a href=/2015/06/17/isomorphic-react-flux-stack/><img src=/images/default_summary_hu2be732aee21a2469ead3fe1f2df8caca_2088687_600x0_resize_q75_box.jpg alt></a></figure><h3 class="title is-5 refresh-summary-title">Searching for an Isomorphic Reactiflux Stack</h3><p class=refresh-summary>Now that Relay is out in preview, it will probably replace Flux entirely.
Why React? A few months ago, the release of React Native by Facebook convinced me to make the leap to React.
I spent a while working on a React Native app and quickly learned that I needed to bring in Flux. After watching a few videos and reading a few blogs, I added my own implementation of flux to my react native app.
The javascript nature, minimalism, isomorphic potential, and cross platform possibilities were almost too good to be true. I fell in love with the stack and set out to refine the set of tools I'm using around my personal priorities.
Goals Isomorphic app Having the right information at page load is essential Not having to compromise on interactivity is the dream Native mobile support Get as close to write once, run anywhere as possible Without sacrificing quality Sustainable tools Ensure all tools use sound engineering practices Make sure there is either a stable following to a tool or an easy pivot High quality testing Stack should be designed to hold complexity well Regression tests should be simple and clear What I've tried so far&amp;hellip; Why not go with vanilla Flux? Using only the Flux tools given by Facebook seems like a no-brainer, but besides being extraneously verbose, you have to maintain, grow, and enforce the framework yourself.
Pros Pretty good assurance that it will not fall out of popularity and leave you stranded. Cons Verbose in a bad way Leaves a ton of tooling to the imagination I lot of ways to mess up Left to your own devices on isomorphism Fluxible A full featured flux framework from Yahoo.
Pros Isomorphic Lots of convenience functionality Yahoo backs it and they still are a large company Cons A touch magical Pretty large Still a bit verbose Reflux A minimalistic rethinking of Flux for the functional programming world.
Pros Simplicity Relatively small Easy to conceptualize and get started No dispatcher, it is built in Cons Not isomorphic Small bits of built in magic, make it less flexible Suggests creating stores that subscribe to other stores This could create hidden complexity layers deep Flummox Minimal isomorphic Flux.
Cons Readme says it will not be supported Pros Gave me the name of a framework the author likes better Redux Advertised as &amp;ldquo;Atomic Flux with hot reloading,&amp;rdquo; A minimalistic, isomorphic take on Flux that is bare bones but extensible.
Current Winner In spite of its small following and young API, the minimalistic approach only gets as far from the vanilla implementation of Flux as you want it to. This would make it relatively easy to pivot to another Flux implementation of maintain independantly.
Pros Minimalistic Extensible Isomorphic Hot reloads code Dispatcher optional, atomic by default Cons Pre-1.0 API likely to have breaking changes Smaller following May not be a winner Update Log 2015-06-17: Published 2015-08-14: Added note about Relay</p><div class="action has-text-right"><a href=/2015/06/17/isomorphic-react-flux-stack/ class="button is-primary">Read more</a></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></section><section class=section><div class=container><div class=columns><div class="column is-centered-tablet-portrait"><h1 class="title section-title">noob</h1><h5 class="subtitle is-5 is-muted"></h5><div class=divider></div><div class=section><div class=container><div class=columns></div><div class=columns><div class="column is-4"><div class=box><figure class="image is-3by2"><a href=/2014/11/15/ux-that-grows-complexity-with-the-user-not-the/><img src=/images/default_summary_hu2be732aee21a2469ead3fe1f2df8caca_2088687_600x0_resize_q75_box.jpg alt></a></figure><h3 class="title is-5 refresh-summary-title">UX that grows complexity with the user, not the product</h3><p class=refresh-summary>This makes complete sense. Why would I need to plan a tactical assault in a videogame before I know how to fire my gun?
Great, now lets jump back to user experience. Since I work on the web, lets use the web as an example. Not to single anything out, but Google Analytics is a complex platform that has had a long time to mature, lets use it as an example.
In Google Analytics, why would I want to benchmark my user’s location when I haven’t even been introduced to even the most basic vocabulary of the platform, like what’s a user, vs. a pageview, vs. a session.
Now okay, lets take a step back from the criticism. There is a nice youtube tutorial to help you figure things out, but people who surf the web are doers. If they see a complex interface in front of them, they don’t want to hold back and watch a video. They are going to press all the buttons until they figure it out.
What would I prefer? Less buttons. Give me a chart with simple pageviews. Once I get comfortable with a pageview, tell me “hey! I bet you are frustrated with returning users being counted as new pageviews. Guess what? We’ve got something for you, its called users. If you look at the number of users you’ll see unique visits to your website.
Sure that might mean that as a new user, I can’t track my acquisition campaigns. But what the hell is an acquisition campaign? Is someone buying me new websites?
Kidding aside, you can have complex mature platforms that don’t overwhelm users, it just takes a little extra effort.</p><div class="action has-text-right"><a href=/2014/11/15/ux-that-grows-complexity-with-the-user-not-the/ class="button is-primary">Read more</a></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></section><section class=section><div class=container><div class=columns><div class="column is-centered-tablet-portrait"><h1 class="title section-title">object oriented</h1><h5 class="subtitle is-5 is-muted"></h5><div class=divider></div><div class=section><div class=container><div class=columns></div><div class=columns><div class="column is-4"><div class=box><figure class="image is-3by2"><a href=/2014/11/15/oo-code-isnt-spaghetti-proof/><img src=/images/default_summary_hu2be732aee21a2469ead3fe1f2df8caca_2088687_600x0_resize_q75_box.jpg alt></a></figure><h3 class="title is-5 refresh-summary-title">OO code isn't spaghetti proof</h3><p class=refresh-summary>Today I had another terrifying, tear swallowing pull request moment. It involved clearly abstracted pieces of our system being clearly and purposefully coupled. If this doesn&amp;rsquo;t bring you to your knees let me try and illustrate why this is so bad.
You are the kind of developer that pardon my french, &amp;ldquo;gets shit done.&amp;rdquo; Because you are such a doer, you connect the first input with the desired output. You repeat this with a different input and output a few times. Then you have two inputs that have the same desired outcome so you hook that up. Then maybe you depend on that output as the input to something else you need to decide on. This keeps going on taking whatever input is needed for the job and producing the desired outcome on the system. Eventually this happens.
Quick homework, look at the system we&amp;rsquo;ve produced and figure out what action caused what, and what state the system is in, and what will happen if you change a piece.
Now imagine instead of just &amp;ldquo;making it happen&amp;rdquo; you built your system as small, well tested tools that adhere to standard interfaces that can be moved around easily and used with each other fluidly. You&amp;rsquo;d have something closer to this.
Now where do you draw the lines between your tools? How do you create the interfaces? Aren&amp;rsquo;t the lines just imaginary?
These are questions that may cause you to dismiss the need, but think about the lego. Are there other ways lego could have made bricks fit together in a consistent fashion? Would the building blocks have been just as successful? Yes the lines are imaginary, and no it really doesn&amp;rsquo;t make so much of a difference where you draw them. The important thing is that they are consistent and you stick with them, even if it means rethinking a minor detail in a feature, because if you don&amp;rsquo;t, well&amp;hellip;</p><div class="action has-text-right"><a href=/2014/11/15/oo-code-isnt-spaghetti-proof/ class="button is-primary">Read more</a></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></section><section class=section><div class=container><div class=columns><div class="column is-centered-tablet-portrait"><h1 class="title section-title">opinion</h1><h5 class="subtitle is-5 is-muted"></h5><div class=divider></div><div class=section><div class=container><div class=columns></div><div class=columns><div class="column is-4"><div class=box><figure class="image is-3by2"><a href=/post/2017-12-07-idiom-shmidiom/><img src=/images/default_summary_hu2be732aee21a2469ead3fe1f2df8caca_2088687_600x0_resize_q75_box.jpg alt></a></figure><h3 class="title is-5 refresh-summary-title">The Dangers of Idiomatic Programming</h3><p class=refresh-summary>What does it mean to be idiomatic?
&amp;ldquo;Of, relating to, or conforming to idiom&amp;rdquo; - Merriam-Webster
So what is an idiom?
&amp;ldquo;The syntactical, grammatical, or structural form peculiar to a language&amp;rdquo; - Merriam-Webster
When we talk about idiomatic programming, we are talking about doing things because it is &amp;ldquo;the way&amp;rdquo; to do them, or because so-and-so says this is a rule that can’t be broken.
Why is it important to see past these idioms and understand why they are &amp;ldquo;the way?&amp;rdquo;
Just to be clear, it is not my intent to prove that you shouldn’t follow these idioms. In fact, I think you should follow them, but remember to &amp;ldquo;know before you go.&amp;rdquo; To convince you, I will try and reject the hypothesis that &amp;ldquo;you should always follow the best idioms regardless of the situation.&amp;rdquo;
Let me take as my example, the golden rule. For those of you that don’t know, the golden rule is something us Americans are taught in preschool that usually is somewhere along the lines of &amp;ldquo;do unto others as you would have them do unto you.&amp;rdquo; I think we can all agree that it is a pretty good rule to follow. In order to reject my hypothesis, I just need to find a situation where this is not the right thing to do. Does this mean that I am a bad person, or that I think any less of whomever came up with the golden rule? No.
Now, let's say you have a cabin in the woods. I’m not talking up in Westchester, I’m talking Canadian wilderness area. Someone comes across your property, and they are obviously lost, probably hungry, cold and tired. You are like really into the golden rule, super idiomatic, and a very nice person. You invite them in, offer them food, share your fire, and even let them use your radio to call into town. This is a great scenario for both people, new friendships are made, a life is potentially saved. Now let's make a slight adjustment.
What if you were a masochist? That is, someone who likes inflicting pain on themselves. It isn’t all that uncommon. A child goes through repeated, traumatic, painful experiences, and grows up taking pleasure in the feeling of pain. Now you are that child all grown up, have that same cabin in the woods, and are super idiomatic about the golden rule. What do you think you will do with this visitor?
I'm not going to continue because I think it is safe to say the hypothesis has been rejected.
So instead of being idiomatic, you can realize that even the most thoughtful and skilled individual can’t think of every possible situation in which their words can be applied. It is far better to understand the reasoning behind those words and use the lessons learned to improve your approach going forward.

&amp;hellip;
Well, I've had some time to digest my thoughts, and I think it is time for, a second blog post.
Whenever I think something needs redefining, the first thing I like to do is look for a definition (shocking right?). The Merriam-Webster dictionary defines and Operating System as:
Software that controls the operation of a computer and directs the processing of programs (as by assigning storage space in memory and controlling input and output functions)
The problem with this definition is that it is too anchored in the challenges of early computing that involved managing the hardware nuances of different machines and creating a predictable environment in which to work at a higher level.
Fast forward a few decades, and we are living in a world where the challenges of computing, solved each in a separate way, are taming the unique complexities of different devices for the purpose of operating different classes of predictable environments for different types of users.
We spread the gospel of Linux, because it has done so much to advance the state of operating systems and put everyone on the same page when it comes to bringing systems from a hardware level, into the world of software. But companies like Apple, Google, and Samsung build different layers of systems on top of unix/linux. Are these systems not also &amp;ldquo;operating systems?&amp;rdquo; Does a system really have to be dealing in bits to be called an operating system?
If you really do need to be managing a physical computer to be an operating, what does an OS become when it is on a virtual machine? It clearly has a purpose since we use virtual machines all the time, but it isn't an operating system by our old definition, it is in fact, a brilliant hack.
Here is an even more controversial one, is a desktop manager like GNOME or KDE an operating system? I would argue that it is. When you hear my definition of an operating system, you will understand why. In my mind, an Operating System is:
A collection of components that work together atop a general purpose machine to make a consistent interface that is more conducive to a particular purpose.
You may be wondering why I care so much about what constitutes an OS. The answer is pretty simple. If we redefine an OS like this, an OS gains a property that I believe to be essential to the challenges of computing that lie ahead.
Operating Systems become composable.
Composability is a very important topic in software engineering. In fact, it is a major component of the Unix philosophy that embodies the spirit of most of the successful operating systems in use today.
As the number of different devices grows, so will the number of things we do with those devices. In the same vein, the things we do with those devices, we will inherently want to be able to reproduce on other devices, from slight changes in marketed products, to full on simulations in different environments.
Moving our definition of an Operating System away from the metal, will allow us to define clear, standard interfaces that our operating systems provide along with clear, standard interfaces that our operating systems consume. The technology world will benefit greatly if we put an end to hacking together virtual machines, container solutions, and Operating Systems built on stripped down modified versions of other operating systems.

Excuse me? What century are we in?
Let me clarify, when I am running linux in a container to build applications the operating system should not be bothering me with arbitrary user systems.
When was the last time you logged into a multi-user unix system that had other users on it? Was it in your CS department in college? Me too.
We don't share computers anymore, even toddlers get their own phones with more computing power than you had in your desktop when Linux was born. Not only do we not share computers, it is actually the opposite, computers share us. Many companies have figured that out by now, using the &amp;ldquo;cloud&amp;rdquo; to build multi computer operating systems.
So I say no one is actually leveraging multi user linux systems in a way that is intuitive, and you say, well what about enterprise and large institutions. Well, if they are managing servers that multiple people log into, they should probably think about modernizing the way they orchestrate their systems.
Let me explain what I mean, and to do so I will divide up the uses of Linux into two categories.
Running a remote service for people to use. Running a local machine for someone to use. When solving for the first, you might say, &amp;ldquo;I want all my users to log in and have complete access to a unix environment.&amp;rdquo; To that, I would ask &amp;ldquo;Do you really need a whole unix environment to use service, or can you build a more direct interface?&amp;rdquo; If the answer is you need a unix environment, I would say, you should build containers for your users and log them into containers. However, the answer is much more likely to be no, we just need our users to check their email, to which I would say, you probably just want to run an email service and have it communicate with some central authorization service. To that you might say, &amp;ldquo;That is exactly what I'll do, except I'll just use unix permissions for my authorization because it is there.&amp;rdquo; To that I would ask, &amp;ldquo;Do you really want your service authorization coupled to your computer operating system?&amp;rdquo; Operating systems are made to run hardware to the point where it becomes a generic, pluggable system to run software. What if you got new hardware that was better, but required a different operating system, do you want to port your authorization to the new system? A better way to solve this problem, would be to look for a solid, system independent authorization module and use that.
Now how about the second use case? This takes us back to the fact that we no longer share computers, and if we did, it wouldn't be the responsibility of the computer operating system to manage this, it would be a service on top. Let's look at android for instance, now I will admit I don't know a whole lot about how the internals relate to linux, but I do know what the security focus has been on, and it hasn't been user level security, it has been app level. Users install software from a plethora of sources, and they don't fully understand the consequences of doing so. A system like android has built authorization and sandboxing around each application, giving it permission to access only what it needs to do the job it has. That isn't to say that android doesn't leverage the multi-user nature of linux, but it certainly doesn't need to, and it doesn't exactly fit cleanly into the paradigm of multi-system users that it is building for.
I am happy to have a discussion about this (maybe it already exists), but I would love to see a version of linux that did away with multiple users and instead focused on app level security.

If you really do need to be managing a physical computer to be an operating, what does an OS become when it is on a virtual machine? It clearly has a purpose since we use virtual machines all the time, but it isn't an operating system by our old definition, it is in fact, a brilliant hack.
Here is an even more controversial one, is a desktop manager like GNOME or KDE an operating system? I would argue that it is. When you hear my definition of an operating system, you will understand why. In my mind, an Operating System is:
A collection of components that work together atop a general purpose machine to make a consistent interface that is more conducive to a particular purpose.
You may be wondering why I care so much about what constitutes an OS. The answer is pretty simple. If we redefine an OS like this, an OS gains a property that I believe to be essential to the challenges of computing that lie ahead.
Operating Systems become composable.
Composability is a very important topic in software engineering. In fact, it is a major component of the Unix philosophy that embodies the spirit of most of the successful operating systems in use today.
As the number of different devices grows, so will the number of things we do with those devices. In the same vein, the things we do with those devices, we will inherently want to be able to reproduce on other devices, from slight changes in marketed products, to full on simulations in different environments.
Moving our definition of an Operating System away from the metal, will allow us to define clear, standard interfaces that our operating systems provide along with clear, standard interfaces that our operating systems consume. The technology world will benefit greatly if we put an end to hacking together virtual machines, container solutions, and Operating Systems built on stripped down modified versions of other operating systems.

On the web, that means using Heroku, but with a react native app it is a bit more complicated.
My react native app has two components, the packager (for serving the client code) and the server (for interacting with the app).
Heroku only lets one process bind to an external port, so it wasn't easy to do without creating two heroku apps.
My solution was to proxy the bundle from the server, the problem with this, is that if the packager is running in a worker, it can't be reached over localhost.
The packager is launched via a shell script, and by opening it, I can see what javascript file is being run. All I had to do was require the packager in my server (yes I know I could just use a node child process, but this is cooler).
My server uses websockets, so this is how I added the proxy&amp;hellip;
You will see that I also added react-native-env and made an environment.plist ala this blog post with a hostname so that my application will know which server to use.
To change environments I just swap out the environment.plist with one that has a different hostname.</p><div class="action has-text-right"><a href=/2015/07/26/react-native-on-heroku/ class="button is-primary">Read more</a></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></section><section class=section><div class=container><div class=columns><div class="column is-centered-tablet-portrait"><h1 class="title section-title">pandemic</h1><h5 class="subtitle is-5 is-muted"></h5><div class=divider></div><div class=section><div class=container><div class=columns></div><div class=columns><div class="column is-4"><div class=box><figure class="image is-3by2"><a href=/post/2020-04-05-quarantine-workout/><img src=/images/default_summary_hu2be732aee21a2469ead3fe1f2df8caca_2088687_600x0_resize_q75_box.jpg alt></a></figure><h3 class="title is-5 refresh-summary-title">Quarantine Rule #1: Exercise every day</h3><p class=refresh-summary>It may sound like a lot, but if you are like me and your quarantine space is limited to a studio apartment, then it is probably the most essential thing you can do to stay sane. The three groups of exercise I alternate between are:
Anaerobic Aerobic Stretching As an experienced introvert, it may not come as a surprise to you that exercise is one of the things I tend to go long periods neglecting, but in this new COVID-19 world, I decided it was mission critical so I went on a YouTube research quest to figure out what I was going to do for exercise.
My goals on this quest were to get a good anaerobic workout that didn’t take too much time or require any special equipment. After devising my super sophisticated research plan, I typed “workout” into youtube and started scrolling through the results. My hypothesis was that if I wanted to get a good workout, I need to find someone who has a similar body type to me. This means that as much as I wanted to get my workout information from the attractive young lady, I chose a video by a smallish frame asian dude who’s muscles I could imagine wearing.
Since the goal of this blogpost isn’t to endorse my youtube workout coach I will not post a link, but I did like the video very much because it explained the reasoning behind all the workout decisions and talked about how many reps you should do in terms of how many you can do rather than giving a specific number. Also, because the trainer was targeting COVID watchers, the only equipment I needed for this workout was two sheets with a knot tied to hang over the door.
The video recommends only doing the workout every other day, but I need to work out every day for my sanity, this means I need some kind of an aerobic workout. Now, my usual solution would be to play music and jump around until I’m sweaty, but I noticed this was too time consuming as it would take me awhile to get tired. I also noticed that sitting at a desk for a long time was making me feel lousy.
This is when I decided to buy a mini elliptical to put under my improvised standing desk. This way I can work while doing my aerobics so it is okay if it takes a bit longer. This has a small impact on shower planning, but I am confident you can figure that out.
Finally, after a week of alternating between full body and aerobic workouts, you may find at the end of the week that you are just exhausted and can’t do it anymore. At least, that is what happened to me. That is when I decided to designate a stretching day. Stretching day came when my muscles were just not willing to do another workout. On stretching day, I went on YouTube and searched for stretches for the parts of my body that ached and after watching a flamboyant doctor tell me all the ways I should bend to loosen the muscles that were tight, I felt a lot better.
Hopefully walking you through my experience with exercising in quarantine will give you the motivation you need to get YouTube fired up and do some exercising yourself. Stay tuned for the rest of my quarantutorials.</p><div class="action has-text-right"><a href=/post/2020-04-05-quarantine-workout/ class="button is-primary">Read more</a></div></div></div><div class="column is-4"><div class=box><figure class="image is-3by2"><a href=/post/2020-04-05-quarantine-life/><img src=/images/default_summary_hu2be732aee21a2469ead3fe1f2df8caca_2088687_600x0_resize_q75_box.jpg alt></a></figure><h3 class="title is-5 refresh-summary-title">Quarantine Tips from Experienced Introvert</h3><p class=refresh-summary>The year is 2003.

The temptation is strong, but the draw of my new computer that I had been obsessing over is even stronger.
Fast-forward to 2020. COVID-19 terrorizes the world and we are all forced to quarantine until god knows when. That temptation to go outside and play, to socialize and do things in person is gone. Now suddenly that world that I've been so drawn to my entire life is the world everyone else is suddenly living in.

Now I may not be the best developer that ever lived, but I’ve worked several years in the industry and I’ve gotten 98 LinkedIn profile views in the last 90 days and get a message about a development job every day or two without any outbound searching, so there is a good chance I’m not the worst.

There are many reasons to go after part time development contracts that don’t involve being lazy. In my case, it is to keep my mind fresh and avoid tunnel vision.
When we stare at a problem too long we lose perspective on it, we focus on details that don’t matter, we get caught up on things that aren’t worth our attention.

This principle is complicated by the fact that a whole team is focused on the same problems for long periods of time. Disagreements are bound to surface, stubbornness is bound to win out over reason, and politics will likely decide the outcome.

&amp;ldquo;Of, relating to, or conforming to idiom&amp;rdquo; - Merriam-Webster
So what is an idiom?
&amp;ldquo;The syntactical, grammatical, or structural form peculiar to a language&amp;rdquo; - Merriam-Webster
When we talk about idiomatic programming, we are talking about doing things because it is &amp;ldquo;the way&amp;rdquo; to do them, or because so-and-so says this is a rule that can’t be broken.
Why is it important to see past these idioms and understand why they are &amp;ldquo;the way?&amp;rdquo;
Just to be clear, it is not my intent to prove that you shouldn’t follow these idioms. In fact, I think you should follow them, but remember to &amp;ldquo;know before you go.&amp;rdquo; To convince you, I will try and reject the hypothesis that &amp;ldquo;you should always follow the best idioms regardless of the situation.&amp;rdquo;
Let me take as my example, the golden rule. For those of you that don’t know, the golden rule is something us Americans are taught in preschool that usually is somewhere along the lines of &amp;ldquo;do unto others as you would have them do unto you.&amp;rdquo; I think we can all agree that it is a pretty good rule to follow. In order to reject my hypothesis, I just need to find a situation where this is not the right thing to do. Does this mean that I am a bad person, or that I think any less of whomever came up with the golden rule? No.
Now, let's say you have a cabin in the woods. I’m not talking up in Westchester, I’m talking Canadian wilderness area. Someone comes across your property, and they are obviously lost, probably hungry, cold and tired. You are like really into the golden rule, super idiomatic, and a very nice person. You invite them in, offer them food, share your fire, and even let them use your radio to call into town. This is a great scenario for both people, new friendships are made, a life is potentially saved. Now let's make a slight adjustment.
What if you were a masochist? That is, someone who likes inflicting pain on themselves. It isn’t all that uncommon. A child goes through repeated, traumatic, painful experiences, and grows up taking pleasure in the feeling of pain. Now you are that child all grown up, have that same cabin in the woods, and are super idiomatic about the golden rule. What do you think you will do with this visitor?
I'm not going to continue because I think it is safe to say the hypothesis has been rejected.
So instead of being idiomatic, you can realize that even the most thoughtful and skilled individual can’t think of every possible situation in which their words can be applied. It is far better to understand the reasoning behind those words and use the lessons learned to improve your approach going forward.

Look for all the individual places the pattern changed. Check to see that a few of them make sense. Observe how they differ, and maybe search through the code independently looking for parts that may have been missed or intentionally left out. If you find inconsistencies comment and ask about them.
If you agree with the pattern change and you look through them and they all look good, then all you need to do is go through the rest of your normal PR checklist and you’re good to approve it.
If you don’t agree with the pattern change in general, comment on where the pattern could do better. Maybe there is a reason the pattern isn’t that way.
Large feature added If there is a new feature, the first thing to check after you know you want the feature, is all the points where the new code touches existing code. If you find out how it interfaces you can box it in your mind and it will be less overwhelming.
Are the interfaces with the rest of your code standard? Is the new code structured in a way that is consistent with all of your patterns? Is the new code tested? Is the new code integration tested with the rest of the system?
Briefly read through the implementation and check for any faulty assumptions about the existing code. If you find faulty assumptions, point them out so the new feature can be fixed. If you start having common assumptions about different parts of your code that are off, that is a code smell and you should probably address it.
Once you’ve asked all the questions and read through the code, have someone else look at it and then sign off.

Why am I stating the obvious? Well, it is quite simply to emphasize just how important it is where we draw those lines.
To illustrate this, lets start all the way on the left side of the machine instruction / common understanding spectrum. By that I mean a simple procedural program. This program needs to do a list of technological things. For instance, it needs to take input, process the input and react to it, displaying some output.
As my list of instructions grows, my understandability shrinks. But I'm a software engineer, I can fix this! If we just split up our code into separate responsabilities, the complexity is managed.
So now we have a place to put code that handles input, a place to put code that handles business logic and a place to format my output. However, the complexity of our code is not done growing. We now have different types of input, more rules to apply to process the input, and multiple ways of displaying the same input. But I'm a software engineer, I can fix this.
Lets get more specific about responsabilities, we can split the input set and handle different kinds of input in different places, some of our business logic does one thing to our data while other business logic does another thing, we can split that up, and we can create decorators for all the ways we need to display our state!
After all that complexity management, I think it is time to meet with the client and show them how cool their app is going to be. Enter client&amp;hellip; &amp;lsquo;wow, great work you guys, I hope it isn't a problem that we are thinking about changing widgets to have round tuits and respond to thingy mabobers.&amp;rsquo;
Now we realize our mistake. We've been so busy putting everything in our neat little piles, we didn't realize that the imaginary lines we've been drawing to do it were around concepts completely tangential to our domain. Meaning, in order to change a concept, we need to change it in 40 places neatly hidden by gems that magically composes services so you don't have to think about them. By the time we are done tracking down the things we need to change, we better cross our fingers and hope it all still works (Or run our test suit that grows exponentially in size).
So we've learned our lesson, what do we do differently next time? How do we avoid the same mistake? The answer to that is quite simple, draw your imaginary lines along your domain, rather than your technologies.
What does that mean in the real world?
Well having a product component in react that has the styles declared right under the react component and the required data declared just under that in a relay container follows this principle
However, a controller that processes a request for a product in a separate file from a model that does logic for the product and another file that displays the product and another file that adds a layer on top of the product for another display, does not follow this principle.</p><div class="action has-text-right"><a href=/2016/04/01/imaginary-lines/ class="button is-primary">Read more</a></div></div></div><div class="column is-4"><div class=box><figure class="image is-3by2"><a href=/2014/12/04/voltrb-first-impressions/><img src=/images/default_summary_hu2be732aee21a2469ead3fe1f2df8caca_2088687_600x0_resize_q75_box.jpg alt></a></figure><h3 class="title is-5 refresh-summary-title">Voltrb first impressions</h3><p class=refresh-summary>Also, opal compiles my ruby to JavaScript, but I don’t notice any of it.

I visited the image in the browser and realized that the browser supported the format, so the broken preview had to be somewhere in filepicker.
In my case I was using a(n) .ico file and since filepicker.io only supports post processing on .jpg and .png I had to come up with a work around.
Once I realized the breakage was in the /convert directive that was automatically filled in for me by the rails gods, the search was on. I dug through the application layer and the gem and I couldn&amp;rsquo;t get it to relinquish its post processing madness.
So I did what any programmer would do. I hacked the preview to use the plain filepicker url instead of decorating it and it worked great™. I used javascript but I&amp;rsquo;m sure the tangled mess you end up different will require different scissors.

When I get in, I wait for the other people I noticed on the security line. When they are done, we take off. We are heading straight up to meet our airplane. The airplanes do regular loops to form a network around the world. They never have to come down except for maintenance since they are refilled by the drone ships. This means there are always planes above to go to. We dock with the airplane and I get out.
I find a seat and look out the window. It is beautiful to look down on a miniature version of the world. I get a notification from my app that in 10 minutes we are crossing paths with the transatlantic loop. I am instructed to wait in the elevator for my transfer, and like a good boy, I do as I'm told.
We get to the transatlantic loop and the plane is a bit more comfortable. They even have snacks and meals for sale. I usually get something because these trips are long and I always forget to bring food.
I spend the plane ride watching videos on my phone with the help of a VR headset gluing it to my face. Before I know it, I get another notification telling me we are nearing the French loop. Again I go wait in the elevator. The plane has a bunch of different faces by the time I go, since we already met the UK loop and the Eurasia loop to exchange passengers.
The next notification I get will be for Paris. I told me friend I was coming so he is meeting me at the Louvre. While I was on the transatlantic loop, I changed my destination so I could land near there. I get the notification, and only have to walk a few blocks and I'm there.
After lunch with my friend, I'm ready to go back to New York. It is easy enough, and I don't mind the trip. It is a great view and I can get a lot of work done.</p><div class="action has-text-right"><a href=/post/2017-10-17-future-airplanes/ class="button is-primary">Read more</a></div></div></div><div class="column is-4"><div class=box><figure class="image is-3by2"><a href=/2014/07/27/wishlist-series/><img src=/images/default_summary_hu2be732aee21a2469ead3fe1f2df8caca_2088687_600x0_resize_q75_box.jpg alt></a></figure><h3 class="title is-5 refresh-summary-title">Wishlist Series</h3><p class=refresh-summary>Those of you who know me already know I am a man of many wishes and dreams.

When I work occasionally to get these projects out of my head and into code, I will pull on any open source threads I am given. The really cool part about this is I usually end up finding the people who are already trying to do what I am setting out to do. Most of the time, they are way ahead of me.
My usual course of action is to abandon yet another project and move on with my life, knowing full well that it meant forgetting about the hand full of cool (from my perspective at least) feature sets I had planned for my project that did not match up with the one I found.
No more! Henceforth, I will provide at no cost (worth the price), my good advice. Posts will be wishlist themed and tweeted aggressively at the company I think is closest to my fantasy product.

Why am I stating the obvious? Well, it is quite simply to emphasize just how important it is where we draw those lines.
To illustrate this, lets start all the way on the left side of the machine instruction / common understanding spectrum. By that I mean a simple procedural program. This program needs to do a list of technological things. For instance, it needs to take input, process the input and react to it, displaying some output.
As my list of instructions grows, my understandability shrinks. But I'm a software engineer, I can fix this! If we just split up our code into separate responsabilities, the complexity is managed.
So now we have a place to put code that handles input, a place to put code that handles business logic and a place to format my output. However, the complexity of our code is not done growing. We now have different types of input, more rules to apply to process the input, and multiple ways of displaying the same input. But I'm a software engineer, I can fix this.
Lets get more specific about responsabilities, we can split the input set and handle different kinds of input in different places, some of our business logic does one thing to our data while other business logic does another thing, we can split that up, and we can create decorators for all the ways we need to display our state!

By the time we are done tracking down the things we need to change, we better cross our fingers and hope it all still works (Or run our test suit that grows exponentially in size).
So we've learned our lesson, what do we do differently next time? How do we avoid the same mistake? The answer to that is quite simple, draw your imaginary lines along your domain, rather than your technologies.

On the web, that means using Heroku, but with a react native app it is a bit more complicated.
My react native app has two components, the packager (for serving the client code) and the server (for interacting with the app).
Heroku only lets one process bind to an external port, so it wasn't easy to do without creating two heroku apps.
My solution was to proxy the bundle from the server, the problem with this, is that if the packager is running in a worker, it can't be reached over localhost.
The packager is launched via a shell script, and by opening it, I can see what javascript file is being run. All I had to do was require the packager in my server (yes I know I could just use a node child process, but this is cooler).
My server uses websockets, so this is how I added the proxy&amp;hellip;
You will see that I also added react-native-env and made an environment.plist ala this blog post with a hostname so that my application will know which server to use.

Have a look.
When people talk about Relay they think of it as the server-client link in the Facebook stack, but is that really all it is?
Flux still has a place on the client because you need to manage temporary app state, right?
I think it doesn't. Flux is an architecture for unidirectional data flow that separates out input from the user and the server so that it can react without getting tangled up. It does so at the high cost of tremendous verbosity and a significant drop in top down readability.
Enter Relay. Relay is a higher level abstraction that wraps React components in containers that declaratively specify data to sync with the server. Since Relay uses GraphQL to communicate with the server, it doesn't seem like there is a solution for temporary app state. Relay does, however, provide a much cleaner way to organize the data of your app, so why would you go back to Flux instead of creating a solution on the same level of abstraction?
GraphQL server in the browser? Why not? You could create an in-memory GraphQL database for temporary app state if you need to.
React transmit is a Relay framework which replaces GraphQL with plain old JS Promises. I have been using it for the time being to structure the data of my apps. I have also been fortunate enough to stumble upon the temporary state issue and solved it the way I suggested above, by querying local stores from Transmit instead of querying the server.
Basically, it needs to choose a random ID between 0 and 999 and keep some memory of which ones have already been chosen.
Here is the client-side store and here is the view that uses it&amp;hellip;

Have a look.
I want to tell you in as few words as possible why I am so excited to get my hands on Relay and GraphQL.
React is widely popular because it is simple and declarative, making it very deterministic and easy to work with. React is also fully composable, making it imensly powerful with high potential for writing reusable code.
Relay is a mirror image of React, except instead of composing beautiful views for the web and native mobile devices using JSX, you can compose data from your database for your views using graphql.

Why React? A few months ago, the release of React Native by Facebook convinced me to make the leap to React.
I spent a while working on a React Native app and quickly learned that I needed to bring in Flux. After watching a few videos and reading a few blogs, I added my own implementation of flux to my react native app.
The javascript nature, minimalism, isomorphic potential, and cross platform possibilities were almost too good to be true. I fell in love with the stack and set out to refine the set of tools I'm using around my personal priorities.
Goals Isomorphic app Having the right information at page load is essential Not having to compromise on interactivity is the dream Native mobile support Get as close to write once, run anywhere as possible Without sacrificing quality Sustainable tools Ensure all tools use sound engineering practices Make sure there is either a stable following to a tool or an easy pivot High quality testing Stack should be designed to hold complexity well Regression tests should be simple and clear What I've tried so far&amp;hellip; Why not go with vanilla Flux? Using only the Flux tools given by Facebook seems like a no-brainer, but besides being extraneously verbose, you have to maintain, grow, and enforce the framework yourself.
Pros Pretty good assurance that it will not fall out of popularity and leave you stranded. Cons Verbose in a bad way Leaves a ton of tooling to the imagination I lot of ways to mess up Left to your own devices on isomorphism Fluxible A full featured flux framework from Yahoo.
Pros Isomorphic Lots of convenience functionality Yahoo backs it and they still are a large company Cons A touch magical Pretty large Still a bit verbose Reflux A minimalistic rethinking of Flux for the functional programming world.
Pros Simplicity Relatively small Easy to conceptualize and get started No dispatcher, it is built in Cons Not isomorphic Small bits of built in magic, make it less flexible Suggests creating stores that subscribe to other stores This could create hidden complexity layers deep Flummox Minimal isomorphic Flux.
Cons Readme says it will not be supported Pros Gave me the name of a framework the author likes better Redux Advertised as &amp;ldquo;Atomic Flux with hot reloading,&amp;rdquo; A minimalistic, isomorphic take on Flux that is bare bones but extensible.

From the time I started working on coffeelint, the problem has been stewing in my head. Subconciously on the lookout for a solution, I heard about codemods. Let me preface by saying I've been quite obsessed with everything facebook engineering has been doing in open source lately. Needless to say I took notice.
I tried to jump in to the game but after playing around with jscodeshift in the super nifty ast explorer I noticed there was a peice missing. Only this time, a mortal human like myself could fill it.
We have been told that facebook has a codemod runner and I have no doubt that there is a bit of process in place governing it. But outside of facebook, we only have a one off runner that is hard to work into a team's process.
Inspired by my desire to solve this problem and an admiration for the way rails handles database migrations I decided to build a code migration tool that wraps jscodeshift. It might be a little rough, since it is hot off the vim, but I'm eager to hear what people think about the concept.

Have a look.
When people talk about Relay they think of it as the server-client link in the Facebook stack, but is that really all it is?
Flux still has a place on the client because you need to manage temporary app state, right?
I think it doesn't. Flux is an architecture for unidirectional data flow that separates out input from the user and the server so that it can react without getting tangled up. It does so at the high cost of tremendous verbosity and a significant drop in top down readability.
Enter Relay. Relay is a higher level abstraction that wraps React components in containers that declaratively specify data to sync with the server. Since Relay uses GraphQL to communicate with the server, it doesn't seem like there is a solution for temporary app state. Relay does, however, provide a much cleaner way to organize the data of your app, so why would you go back to Flux instead of creating a solution on the same level of abstraction?
GraphQL server in the browser? Why not? You could create an in-memory GraphQL database for temporary app state if you need to.
React transmit is a Relay framework which replaces GraphQL with plain old JS Promises. I have been using it for the time being to structure the data of my apps. I have also been fortunate enough to stumble upon the temporary state issue and solved it the way I suggested above, by querying local stores from Transmit instead of querying the server.
Basically, it needs to choose a random ID between 0 and 999 and keep some memory of which ones have already been chosen.
Here is the client-side store and here is the view that uses it&amp;hellip;

Have a look.
I want to tell you in as few words as possible why I am so excited to get my hands on Relay and GraphQL.
React is widely popular because it is simple and declarative, making it very deterministic and easy to work with. React is also fully composable, making it imensly powerful with high potential for writing reusable code.
Relay is a mirror image of React, except instead of composing beautiful views for the web and native mobile devices using JSX, you can compose data from your database for your views using graphql.

Why am I stating the obvious? Well, it is quite simply to emphasize just how important it is where we draw those lines.
To illustrate this, lets start all the way on the left side of the machine instruction / common understanding spectrum. By that I mean a simple procedural program. This program needs to do a list of technological things. For instance, it needs to take input, process the input and react to it, displaying some output.
As my list of instructions grows, my understandability shrinks. But I'm a software engineer, I can fix this! If we just split up our code into separate responsabilities, the complexity is managed.
So now we have a place to put code that handles input, a place to put code that handles business logic and a place to format my output. However, the complexity of our code is not done growing. We now have different types of input, more rules to apply to process the input, and multiple ways of displaying the same input. But I'm a software engineer, I can fix this.
Lets get more specific about responsabilities, we can split the input set and handle different kinds of input in different places, some of our business logic does one thing to our data while other business logic does another thing, we can split that up, and we can create decorators for all the ways we need to display our state!
After all that complexity management, I think it is time to meet with the client and show them how cool their app is going to be. Enter client&amp;hellip; &amp;lsquo;wow, great work you guys, I hope it isn't a problem that we are thinking about changing widgets to have round tuits and respond to thingy mabobers.&amp;rsquo;
Now we realize our mistake. We've been so busy putting everything in our neat little piles, we didn't realize that the imaginary lines we've been drawing to do it were around concepts completely tangential to our domain. Meaning, in order to change a concept, we need to change it in 40 places neatly hidden by gems that magically composes services so you don't have to think about them. By the time we are done tracking down the things we need to change, we better cross our fingers and hope it all still works (Or run our test suit that grows exponentially in size).
So we've learned our lesson, what do we do differently next time? How do we avoid the same mistake? The answer to that is quite simple, draw your imaginary lines along your domain, rather than your technologies.
What does that mean in the real world?
Well having a product component in react that has the styles declared right under the react component and the required data declared just under that in a relay container follows this principle
However, a controller that processes a request for a product in a separate file from a model that does logic for the product and another file that displays the product and another file that adds a layer on top of the product for another display, does not follow this principle.</p><div class="action has-text-right"><a href=/2016/04/01/imaginary-lines/ class="button is-primary">Read more</a></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></section><section class=section><div class=container><div class=columns><div class="column is-centered-tablet-portrait"><h1 class="title section-title">retro</h1><h5 class="subtitle is-5 is-muted"></h5><div class=divider></div><div class=section><div class=container><div class=columns></div><div class=columns><div class="column is-4"><div class=box><figure class="image is-3by2"><a href=/2015/06/25/under-construction/><img src=/images/default_summary_hu2be732aee21a2469ead3fe1f2df8caca_2088687_600x0_resize_q75_box.jpg alt></a></figure><h3 class="title is-5 refresh-summary-title">Bringing back 'Under Construction' in style</h3><p class=refresh-summary>I'm just going to go ahead and say what's on everyone's mind already.

My first reaction to them when I started programming in the real world was to scorn them with the attitude that they introduce unnecessary complication for both the developer and the computer. What good could they possibly do?
Like any programmer thrown into a stack, I faithfully used the established patterns, knowing that any divergence from the standard usually has a much worse effect than dealing with it.
Over time, I grew to like DSLs. Why? Why would a rational developer like myself grow to like something so senseless? As Sandy Metz said once in a talk she gave at Pivotal Labs, trust your gut. Much of your high level thought as a developer, you may not be able to verbalize immediately.
So I trusted myself, and continued using DSLs. Until one day it came to me while I was pairing. The value of a DSL is that it forces the human brain to switch contexts. This makes it much easier to move throughout the code without mashing up context from one problem with another, it’s like namespacing for the brain.</p><div class="action has-text-right"><a href=/2014/12/19/contextualizing-with-dsls/ class="button is-primary">Read more</a></div></div></div><div class="column is-4"><div class=box><figure class="image is-3by2"><a href=/2014/12/10/use-your-yaml-fixtures-as-documentation/><img src=/images/default_summary_hu2be732aee21a2469ead3fe1f2df8caca_2088687_600x0_resize_q75_box.jpg alt></a></figure><h3 class="title is-5 refresh-summary-title">Use your YAML fixtures as documentation</h3><p class=refresh-summary>I spent some time trying to automatically generate HTML documentation from YAML with inline comments.

a corpse said to be revived by witchcraft, esp. in certain African and Caribbean religions.
Early religions lacked the scientific methods to explain everyday events and defaulted to labeling things that couldn&amp;rsquo;t otherwise be explained as witchcraft.
It is through that stretch of the definition of a zombie that allow the walkers on AMC&amp;rsquo;s The Walking Dead to be labeled zombies. Even though we know the walkers to be infected by a virus that seems to be fairly predictable, the same behavior in another culture would have been seen as witchcraft.

I take out my phone, and open my air travel app and put in Paris. It tells me how much it costs, and I click accept. It takes me to a border patrol and security flow where I need to answer some lame questions, but it isn't so bad.
The app informs me which air shuttle to go to. Since there is one every 10 blocks in Manhattan I don't have to go far. I just need to walk to Chelsea market. When I get to the roof, I see an elevator that has four propellers instead of a wire. I get to the door, and I see a border patrol / security officer on a screen who gives me instructions on how to proceed with the security equipment. When I am done, the gates let me through to the elevator.
When I get in, I wait for the other people I noticed on the security line. When they are done, we take off. We are heading straight up to meet our airplane. The airplanes do regular loops to form a network around the world. They never have to come down except for maintenance since they are refilled by the drone ships. This means there are always planes above to go to. We dock with the airplane and I get out.
I find a seat and look out the window. It is beautiful to look down on a miniature version of the world. I get a notification from my app that in 10 minutes we are crossing paths with the transatlantic loop. I am instructed to wait in the elevator for my transfer, and like a good boy, I do as I'm told.
We get to the transatlantic loop and the plane is a bit more comfortable. They even have snacks and meals for sale. I usually get something because these trips are long and I always forget to bring food.
I spend the plane ride watching videos on my phone with the help of a VR headset gluing it to my face. Before I know it, I get another notification telling me we are nearing the French loop. Again I go wait in the elevator. The plane has a bunch of different faces by the time I go, since we already met the UK loop and the Eurasia loop to exchange passengers.
The next notification I get will be for Paris. I told me friend I was coming so he is meeting me at the Louvre. While I was on the transatlantic loop, I changed my destination so I could land near there. I get the notification, and only have to walk a few blocks and I'm there.
After lunch with my friend, I'm ready to go back to New York. It is easy enough, and I don't mind the trip. It is a great view and I can get a lot of work done.</p><div class="action has-text-right"><a href=/post/2017-10-17-future-airplanes/ class="button is-primary">Read more</a></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></section><section class=section><div class=container><div class=columns><div class="column is-centered-tablet-portrait"><h1 class="title section-title">security</h1><h5 class="subtitle is-5 is-muted"></h5><div class=divider></div><div class=section><div class=container><div class=columns></div><div class=columns><div class="column is-4"><div class=box><figure class="image is-3by2"><a href=/post/2017-11-05-multi-user-systems/><img src=/images/default_summary_hu2be732aee21a2469ead3fe1f2df8caca_2088687_600x0_resize_q75_box.jpg alt></a></figure><h3 class="title is-5 refresh-summary-title">Why are operating systems still multi-user?</h3><p class=refresh-summary>So I'm minding my own business, setting up Arch linux in my unrooted Termux installation on my phone, when all of a sudden, makepkg wants me to not be root to run a build. Excuse me? What century are we in?
Let me clarify, when I am running linux in a container to build applications the operating system should not be bothering me with arbitrary user systems.
When was the last time you logged into a multi-user unix system that had other users on it? Was it in your CS department in college? Me too.
We don't share computers anymore, even toddlers get their own phones with more computing power than you had in your desktop when Linux was born. Not only do we not share computers, it is actually the opposite, computers share us. Many companies have figured that out by now, using the &amp;ldquo;cloud&amp;rdquo; to build multi computer operating systems.
So I say no one is actually leveraging multi user linux systems in a way that is intuitive, and you say, well what about enterprise and large institutions. Well, if they are managing servers that multiple people log into, they should probably think about modernizing the way they orchestrate their systems.
Let me explain what I mean, and to do so I will divide up the uses of Linux into two categories.
Running a remote service for people to use. Running a local machine for someone to use. When solving for the first, you might say, &amp;ldquo;I want all my users to log in and have complete access to a unix environment.&amp;rdquo; To that, I would ask &amp;ldquo;Do you really need a whole unix environment to use service, or can you build a more direct interface?&amp;rdquo; If the answer is you need a unix environment, I would say, you should build containers for your users and log them into containers. However, the answer is much more likely to be no, we just need our users to check their email, to which I would say, you probably just want to run an email service and have it communicate with some central authorization service. To that you might say, &amp;ldquo;That is exactly what I'll do, except I'll just use unix permissions for my authorization because it is there.&amp;rdquo; To that I would ask, &amp;ldquo;Do you really want your service authorization coupled to your computer operating system?&amp;rdquo; Operating systems are made to run hardware to the point where it becomes a generic, pluggable system to run software. What if you got new hardware that was better, but required a different operating system, do you want to port your authorization to the new system? A better way to solve this problem, would be to look for a solid, system independent authorization module and use that.
Now how about the second use case? This takes us back to the fact that we no longer share computers, and if we did, it wouldn't be the responsibility of the computer operating system to manage this, it would be a service on top. Let's look at android for instance, now I will admit I don't know a whole lot about how the internals relate to linux, but I do know what the security focus has been on, and it hasn't been user level security, it has been app level. Users install software from a plethora of sources, and they don't fully understand the consequences of doing so. A system like android has built authorization and sandboxing around each application, giving it permission to access only what it needs to do the job it has. That isn't to say that android doesn't leverage the multi-user nature of linux, but it certainly doesn't need to, and it doesn't exactly fit cleanly into the paradigm of multi-system users that it is building for.
I am happy to have a discussion about this (maybe it already exists), but I would love to see a version of linux that did away with multiple users and instead focused on app level security.

If building a new abstraction is so painful, that it is easier to copy and paste large chunks of code, you need to rethink the way you are building your abstractions. Building the right abstractions isn't just a time consuming distraction from building software, it is software engineering.
With that out of the way, let me try and explain how I decide what to abstract so that years from now when I'm older some obnoxious young know it all can tell me how I've been doing it wrong :-)
Before I do that, I'd like to first try and paint a picture of a software as something that has a life of its own. When it is born, it is only a small cluster of abstract concepts that fit nicely into a solution for the user. But the days of clear cut simplicity are few, as the application grows it is fed features, design changes and bug fixes. Depending on the process your team used to digest all your application's food, you can end up with a beauty or a beast.
Now let's pair back this analogy to something more mathematical that we can better understand as engineers, let's think of our application as a growing crystal. Your core abstractions sit on the inside, and all the features, changes and fixes it is fed cause new abstractions to crystalize around the old ones.
Each addition to the crystal should only contain the thing that makes that abstraction unique, and for the parts that are not unique, it should attach itself to the crystal on which it grows.
What do I mean by attach itself? Well, say I have a user info form and a user info dialog. If I'm following the rule of three, I would just copy the form and be on with my day. Then, two weeks later, developer John Smith joins the project and has no clue about the user info forms. He gets a story to add a user info sidebar, so he looks for a user info form and all he has to do is copy it into the sidebar and presto chango! Meanwhile, it is time to add a field to the user info form (it is required, sorry). The change was easy, but with it, we just broke a dialog and sidebar.
If you were to attach it to the abstractions that are already there, you would compose the form into your new dialog abstraction, and then two weeks later, when John Smith joins the project, you tell him, we go by this philosophy and you link him here. Then, when he needs to add the form to the sidebar, he knows that copy pasting is not okay, and he builds a sidebar component that composes the form. The time comes to add the field to the form, you don't even need to think about anything on the crystal further out than your abstraction because as long as you are meeting the basic expectations of all the users of your abstraction, all of your changes should successfully propagate throughout your app without you having to break a sweat.
Using this technique, so long as you maintain clear interfaces for using your abstraction, when you make a change to it, you only need to worry about the part of your crystal that is directly adjacent towards the inside. This allows you to think in the context of the abstraction you are working on and not have to worry about fringe complexity that was added in after the fact.</p><div class="action has-text-right"><a href=/2016/06/21/crystallize-carfully/ class="button is-primary">Read more</a></div></div></div><div class="column is-4"><div class=box><figure class="image is-3by2"><a href=/2014/11/26/commit-to-a-single-way/><img src=/images/default_summary_hu2be732aee21a2469ead3fe1f2df8caca_2088687_600x0_resize_q75_box.jpg alt></a></figure><h3 class="title is-5 refresh-summary-title">Commit to a single way</h3><p class=refresh-summary>Software engineers are responsible for adding new and unforeseen complexity to established, carefully thought out systems.
It tends to be a reflex when told to add complexity, that we special case the complexity and fall through to the system you had before. This works in many cases and is great if the complexity being added is a footnote that you don&amp;rsquo;t intend to come back to.
Complexity that is essential to the long term success of your product needs to be &amp;ldquo;native.&amp;rdquo;

You would need some consistency in your succinct descriptions otherwise you wouldn’t be able to tell what fits with what.
For instance if you were describing the front and back leg of your couch, and the descriptions were completely different, if you changed a subtle detail in the vanir, it wouldn’t be obvious what other pieces needed to change. On the other hand, if the descriptions were identical, it wouldn’t be clear the the pieces were mirror image of each other.
How do we achieve that level of consistency without over generalizing? The answer is as you may expect, very carefully. Why do you think software engineers make so much money?
A large portion of any software engineers day is spent deciding what to call this or that, and whether a name still describes a piece that has changed.

I spent the first few days figuring out how I want to flavor my soylent. I went through different peanut butter and chocolate combos until I decided to ditch the peanut butter, go for simple cocoa powder, and add sugar.
The difference in how I felt after soylent was immediately clear. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t perfect, but it was better. The pain I felt drinking it was very dull and almost unnoticeable. Because of this, I started drinking soylent almost exclusively without even setting out to.
When I notice the trend I got a little more serious about it. By the second day, the only pain I felt was when I applied pressure to the areas of my intestine that are affected by crohn&amp;rsquo;s. Coming from being in immense pain after every meal, I was ecstatic.
By day three or four, I was entirely pain free.** Now, this hardly constitutes a study and there are plenty of other variables that haven&amp;rsquo;t been isolated, but I&amp;rsquo;m going to call it a success so far. I upped my order of Soylent and it can&amp;rsquo;t arrive soon enough. I would definitely be interested in a study related to the effects of this kind of diet on crohn&amp;rsquo;s, but it probably won&amp;rsquo;t happen unless rosa labs funds something.

It tends to be a reflex when told to add complexity, that we special case the complexity and fall through to the system you had before. This works in many cases and is great if the complexity being added is a footnote that you don&amp;rsquo;t intend to come back to.
Complexity that is essential to the long term success of your product needs to be &amp;ldquo;native.&amp;rdquo;

Excuse me? What century are we in?
Let me clarify, when I am running linux in a container to build applications the operating system should not be bothering me with arbitrary user systems.
When was the last time you logged into a multi-user unix system that had other users on it? Was it in your CS department in college? Me too.
We don't share computers anymore, even toddlers get their own phones with more computing power than you had in your desktop when Linux was born. Not only do we not share computers, it is actually the opposite, computers share us. Many companies have figured that out by now, using the &amp;ldquo;cloud&amp;rdquo; to build multi computer operating systems.
So I say no one is actually leveraging multi user linux systems in a way that is intuitive, and you say, well what about enterprise and large institutions. Well, if they are managing servers that multiple people log into, they should probably think about modernizing the way they orchestrate their systems.
Let me explain what I mean, and to do so I will divide up the uses of Linux into two categories.
Running a remote service for people to use. Running a local machine for someone to use. When solving for the first, you might say, &amp;ldquo;I want all my users to log in and have complete access to a unix environment.&amp;rdquo; To that, I would ask &amp;ldquo;Do you really need a whole unix environment to use service, or can you build a more direct interface?&amp;rdquo; If the answer is you need a unix environment, I would say, you should build containers for your users and log them into containers. However, the answer is much more likely to be no, we just need our users to check their email, to which I would say, you probably just want to run an email service and have it communicate with some central authorization service. To that you might say, &amp;ldquo;That is exactly what I'll do, except I'll just use unix permissions for my authorization because it is there.&amp;rdquo; To that I would ask, &amp;ldquo;Do you really want your service authorization coupled to your computer operating system?&amp;rdquo; Operating systems are made to run hardware to the point where it becomes a generic, pluggable system to run software. What if you got new hardware that was better, but required a different operating system, do you want to port your authorization to the new system? A better way to solve this problem, would be to look for a solid, system independent authorization module and use that.
Now how about the second use case? This takes us back to the fact that we no longer share computers, and if we did, it wouldn't be the responsibility of the computer operating system to manage this, it would be a service on top. Let's look at android for instance, now I will admit I don't know a whole lot about how the internals relate to linux, but I do know what the security focus has been on, and it hasn't been user level security, it has been app level. Users install software from a plethora of sources, and they don't fully understand the consequences of doing so. A system like android has built authorization and sandboxing around each application, giving it permission to access only what it needs to do the job it has. That isn't to say that android doesn't leverage the multi-user nature of linux, but it certainly doesn't need to, and it doesn't exactly fit cleanly into the paradigm of multi-system users that it is building for.
I am happy to have a discussion about this (maybe it already exists), but I would love to see a version of linux that did away with multiple users and instead focused on app level security.

&amp;ldquo;Of, relating to, or conforming to idiom&amp;rdquo; - Merriam-Webster
So what is an idiom?
&amp;ldquo;The syntactical, grammatical, or structural form peculiar to a language&amp;rdquo; - Merriam-Webster
When we talk about idiomatic programming, we are talking about doing things because it is &amp;ldquo;the way&amp;rdquo; to do them, or because so-and-so says this is a rule that can’t be broken.
Why is it important to see past these idioms and understand why they are &amp;ldquo;the way?&amp;rdquo;
Just to be clear, it is not my intent to prove that you shouldn’t follow these idioms. In fact, I think you should follow them, but remember to &amp;ldquo;know before you go.&amp;rdquo; To convince you, I will try and reject the hypothesis that &amp;ldquo;you should always follow the best idioms regardless of the situation.&amp;rdquo;
Let me take as my example, the golden rule. For those of you that don’t know, the golden rule is something us Americans are taught in preschool that usually is somewhere along the lines of &amp;ldquo;do unto others as you would have them do unto you.&amp;rdquo; I think we can all agree that it is a pretty good rule to follow. In order to reject my hypothesis, I just need to find a situation where this is not the right thing to do. Does this mean that I am a bad person, or that I think any less of whomever came up with the golden rule? No.
Now, let's say you have a cabin in the woods. I’m not talking up in Westchester, I’m talking Canadian wilderness area. Someone comes across your property, and they are obviously lost, probably hungry, cold and tired. You are like really into the golden rule, super idiomatic, and a very nice person. You invite them in, offer them food, share your fire, and even let them use your radio to call into town. This is a great scenario for both people, new friendships are made, a life is potentially saved. Now let's make a slight adjustment.
What if you were a masochist? That is, someone who likes inflicting pain on themselves. It isn’t all that uncommon. A child goes through repeated, traumatic, painful experiences, and grows up taking pleasure in the feeling of pain. Now you are that child all grown up, have that same cabin in the woods, and are super idiomatic about the golden rule. What do you think you will do with this visitor?
I'm not going to continue because I think it is safe to say the hypothesis has been rejected.
So instead of being idiomatic, you can realize that even the most thoughtful and skilled individual can’t think of every possible situation in which their words can be applied. It is far better to understand the reasoning behind those words and use the lessons learned to improve your approach going forward.

My first reaction to them when I started programming in the real world was to scorn them with the attitude that they introduce unnecessary complication for both the developer and the computer. What good could they possibly do?
Like any programmer thrown into a stack, I faithfully used the established patterns, knowing that any divergence from the standard usually has a much worse effect than dealing with it.
Over time, I grew to like DSLs. Why? Why would a rational developer like myself grow to like something so senseless? As Sandy Metz said once in a talk she gave at Pivotal Labs, trust your gut. Much of your high level thought as a developer, you may not be able to verbalize immediately.
So I trusted myself, and continued using DSLs. Until one day it came to me while I was pairing. The value of a DSL is that it forces the human brain to switch contexts. This makes it much easier to move throughout the code without mashing up context from one problem with another, it’s like namespacing for the brain.</p><div class="action has-text-right"><a href=/2014/12/19/contextualizing-with-dsls/ class="button is-primary">Read more</a></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></section><section class=section><div class=container><div class=columns><div class="column is-centered-tablet-portrait"><h1 class="title section-title">tumblr</h1><h5 class="subtitle is-5 is-muted"></h5><div class=divider></div><div class=section><div class=container><div class=columns></div><div class=columns><div class="column is-4"><div class=box><figure class="image is-3by2"><a href=/2014/12/30/how-to-submit-your-tumblr-blog-sitemap-to-google/><img src=/images/default_summary_hu2be732aee21a2469ead3fe1f2df8caca_2088687_600x0_resize_q75_box.jpg alt></a></figure><h3 class="title is-5 refresh-summary-title">How-to : Submit your Tumblr blog sitemap to Google Webmaster tools</h3><p class=refresh-summary>How-to : Submit your Tumblr blog sitemap to Google Webmaster toolsaepearson:

I take out my phone, and open my air travel app and put in Paris. It tells me how much it costs, and I click accept. It takes me to a border patrol and security flow where I need to answer some lame questions, but it isn't so bad.
The app informs me which air shuttle to go to. Since there is one every 10 blocks in Manhattan I don't have to go far. I just need to walk to Chelsea market. When I get to the roof, I see an elevator that has four propellers instead of a wire. I get to the door, and I see a border patrol / security officer on a screen who gives me instructions on how to proceed with the security equipment. When I am done, the gates let me through to the elevator.
When I get in, I wait for the other people I noticed on the security line. When they are done, we take off. We are heading straight up to meet our airplane. The airplanes do regular loops to form a network around the world. They never have to come down except for maintenance since they are refilled by the drone ships. This means there are always planes above to go to. We dock with the airplane and I get out.
I find a seat and look out the window. It is beautiful to look down on a miniature version of the world. I get a notification from my app that in 10 minutes we are crossing paths with the transatlantic loop. I am instructed to wait in the elevator for my transfer, and like a good boy, I do as I'm told.
We get to the transatlantic loop and the plane is a bit more comfortable. They even have snacks and meals for sale. I usually get something because these trips are long and I always forget to bring food.
I spend the plane ride watching videos on my phone with the help of a VR headset gluing it to my face. Before I know it, I get another notification telling me we are nearing the French loop. Again I go wait in the elevator. The plane has a bunch of different faces by the time I go, since we already met the UK loop and the Eurasia loop to exchange passengers.
The next notification I get will be for Paris. I told me friend I was coming so he is meeting me at the Louvre. While I was on the transatlantic loop, I changed my destination so I could land near there. I get the notification, and only have to walk a few blocks and I'm there.
After lunch with my friend, I'm ready to go back to New York. It is easy enough, and I don't mind the trip. It is a great view and I can get a lot of work done.</p><div class="action has-text-right"><a href=/post/2017-10-17-future-airplanes/ class="button is-primary">Read more</a></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></section><section class=section><div class=container><div class=columns><div class="column is-centered-tablet-portrait"><h1 class="title section-title">ux design</h1><h5 class="subtitle is-5 is-muted"></h5><div class=divider></div><div class=section><div class=container><div class=columns></div><div class=columns><div class="column is-4"><div class=box><figure class="image is-3by2"><a href=/2014/11/15/ux-that-grows-complexity-with-the-user-not-the/><img src=/images/default_summary_hu2be732aee21a2469ead3fe1f2df8caca_2088687_600x0_resize_q75_box.jpg alt></a></figure><h3 class="title is-5 refresh-summary-title">UX that grows complexity with the user, not the product</h3><p class=refresh-summary>This makes complete sense. Why would I need to plan a tactical assault in a videogame before I know how to fire my gun?
Great, now lets jump back to user experience. Since I work on the web, lets use the web as an example. Not to single anything out, but Google Analytics is a complex platform that has had a long time to mature, lets use it as an example.
In Google Analytics, why would I want to benchmark my user’s location when I haven’t even been introduced to even the most basic vocabulary of the platform, like what’s a user, vs. a pageview, vs. a session.
Now okay, lets take a step back from the criticism. There is a nice youtube tutorial to help you figure things out, but people who surf the web are doers. If they see a complex interface in front of them, they don’t want to hold back and watch a video. They are going to press all the buttons until they figure it out.
What would I prefer? Less buttons. Give me a chart with simple pageviews. Once I get comfortable with a pageview, tell me “hey! I bet you are frustrated with returning users being counted as new pageviews. Guess what? We’ve got something for you, its called users. If you look at the number of users you’ll see unique visits to your website.
Sure that might mean that as a new user, I can’t track my acquisition campaigns. But what the hell is an acquisition campaign? Is someone buying me new websites?
Kidding aside, you can have complex mature platforms that don’t overwhelm users, it just takes a little extra effort.</p><div class="action has-text-right"><a href=/2014/11/15/ux-that-grows-complexity-with-the-user-not-the/ class="button is-primary">Read more</a></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></section><section class=section><div class=container><div class=columns><div class="column is-centered-tablet-portrait"><h1 class="title section-title">voltrb</h1><h5 class="subtitle is-5 is-muted"></h5><div class=divider></div><div class=section><div class=container><div class=columns></div><div class=columns><div class="column is-4"><div class=box><figure class="image is-3by2"><a href=/2014/12/04/voltrb-first-impressions/><img src=/images/default_summary_hu2be732aee21a2469ead3fe1f2df8caca_2088687_600x0_resize_q75_box.jpg alt></a></figure><h3 class="title is-5 refresh-summary-title">Voltrb first impressions</h3><p class=refresh-summary>Also, opal compiles my ruby to JavaScript, but I don’t notice any of it.

Feel free to use the host of your choosing, or host your own box if that’s your cup of tea.
I set up an ubuntu box with a ruby on rails dev environment. The only thing that I had to set up out of the ordinary was XVFB. This is because I have browser tests that run and need an X server even though it is headless. One snag with this, after you get XVFB running, don’t forget to tell your application which display to connect to (for me it was setting the $DISPLAY environment variable).
JuiceSSH On my Nexus 9, I chose JuiceSSH as my SSH client since it has a nice UI and makes ssh tunneling easy.
First I set up a normal connection to my Linode server, follow the instructions that linode gives you.
Next you need to tunnel your dev server port. JuiceSSH makes this easy, just go to your connections and swipe left. Then you will be able to access the dev server of your website from your android.
External Keyboard Helper Pro You will need a bluetooth keyboard of your choosing, the keyboard case is good if you are on the go, but I am much more comfortable on a slightly larger keyboard.
Like many developers, there is at least one key on the keyboard you will need to remap. That key is caps lock. Since all developer’s know caps lock is supposed to be control, this one is a no brainer.
This is pretty easy to do.
On the keyboard case for the Nexus 9, it is a search button. I haven’t found a way to remap it yet, but if you are able to I’d love to hear from you.

Before I go into the solution, let’s look at the problem. At present, out best way of getting to space involves stacking explosives as high as we can, sitting on top with a countdown, and hoping that we planned for all the eventualities.
Setting aside the risk to life and property involved in this, we have the issue of more weight requiring more fuel, which is in turn, more weight. This makes it so launching payloads doesn’t scale linearly.
Inspirational work This all started with a jump back in time to Newton’s cannonball. It certainly would solve for having to carry that pesky fuel? The problem with this, is that if you want to reach orbital velocity, not even accounting for air resistance, the acceleration required would be more than enough to kill you.
But we are determined to get to space! Violent acceleration can’t stop us. What about a train? Those accelerate slowly and get going really fast. This is actually a great idea. You would need a massively long train, but something like Elon Musk’s hyperloop might do. Aside from the capital costs of this approach, we have to deal with air resistance when we exit the hyperloop. This could potentially be solved by building a hyperloop muzzle that ascends into the sky to where the air is thin. I am a huge fan of this idea and it would drastically lower the cost of sending things to space if we are able to invest enough upfront to make it happen. But is there a way we can do something at lower cost now? Can we overcome the challenge of acceleration, fuel weight, and air resistance without being united in the effort by another cold war?
Back to the basics If we think back to the cannon, it works, we can accelerate small pellets past escape velocity with current technology and we have very sophisticated targeting software that could hit a target from very far away. What if we just had a lot of very small guns shooting a space ship to propel it to orbit?
There are more than a couple problems with this, including:
air resistance turbulence complicating targeting obstructions blocking the craft wear on the craft from impact collecting projectiles But if done right, this approach could be very desirable. It could allow our payload to have almost no sophistication, which would make reusability much easier. It also could tie into an electrical grid, which would make it cheap.
Wear on the craft is the easiest to solve. We can use electromagnetic projectiles, or even just make the projectiles very soft and light.
Second easiest to solve for is collection. With a little bit of sophistication on our craft, we can collect the pellets and fire them back at collectors, or without sophistication, we can place collectors where the mass will fall.
Finally, air resistance, turbulence and other atmospheric obstructions are where we really start to scratch our heads. Could these be show stoppers?
Proposal What if we put these little projectile accelerators at the top of the atmosphere? How would we do that? Balloons. If we launched a network of balloons that functioned to fire tiny projectiles rapidly at high velocities, we get a new set of problems, but not ones that can’t be solved.
New problems:
Power Getting payload to upper atmosphere Collecting projectiles (harder) Maintaining balloon fleet Since we are no longer in the ground, we can’t tap into the grid directly, but we can use a combination of solar and microwave charging.
It is harder to fly a payload to high altitude than it is to go from the ground, but airplanes do a pretty good job of that.
The last two are the harder ones, but not unsolvable. For collecting pellets, the payload would have to be equipped with something to catch the pellets and fire them back. Ideally with some kind of targeting pellet spray nozzle with the ability to spread the pellets accross many collectors. The balloons would need to redistribute the pellets amongst themselves. This could be through phisical links between balloons or by relaying shots between balloons. While this is hard, it is not impossible. One way the collection problem could be circumvented, is by making dry ice and not worrying about collection. Would cost a bit more energy, but may be a good fallback.
Finally, we have to maintain a fleet of balloons. Helium is expensive and we would need to make sure each balloon has power, pellets, helium, and a functional microcontroller. While this is daunting, companies have attempted to maintain fleets of balloons in the past, so again, should be doable.
Now I won’t pretend my proposed solution is perfectly safe, or that payloads scale in a perfectly linear fashion, but it seems to make significant leaps in solving both of these issues as well as many others, including reusability.
Future work Seeing as this is the culmination of lots of shower thoughts, and that I’ve never worked in the aerospace industry, there is still lots of work to be done pressure testing the idea.
Parameter setting — set the mass and velocity of the projectiles, determine number of balloons and surface are of balloon network Prove energy transfer to balloons — microwave, solar, etc Network balloons through hardware and/or software — can you share resources between them, stabilize each other Prove that electromagnetic gun can rapid fire light projectiles to satisfy parameters Prove that projectile collection or in air manufacturing is possible I hope that I get a chance to take some of these on in the future. But I’m also interested to hear what other people’s thoughts are. Has anyone explored something similar? Are there obvious things that I missed?</p><div class="action has-text-right"><a href=/post/2019-08-07-high-altitude-mass-volley/ class="button is-primary">Read more</a></div></div></div><div class="column is-4"><div class=box><figure class="image is-3by2"><a href=/post/2017-10-17-future-airplanes/><img src=/images/default_summary_hu2be732aee21a2469ead3fe1f2df8caca_2088687_600x0_resize_q75_box.jpg alt></a></figure><h3 class="title is-5 refresh-summary-title">Future of Flight: Spontaneous trip to Paris</h3><p class=refresh-summary>I want to go to France, I didn't plan to go, I was just waking on the highline and was like, I think I want to go to Paris. I take out my phone, and open my air travel app and put in Paris. It tells me how much it costs, and I click accept. It takes me to a border patrol and security flow where I need to answer some lame questions, but it isn't so bad.
The app informs me which air shuttle to go to. Since there is one every 10 blocks in Manhattan I don't have to go far. I just need to walk to Chelsea market. When I get to the roof, I see an elevator that has four propellers instead of a wire. I get to the door, and I see a border patrol / security officer on a screen who gives me instructions on how to proceed with the security equipment. When I am done, the gates let me through to the elevator.
When I get in, I wait for the other people I noticed on the security line. When they are done, we take off. We are heading straight up to meet our airplane. The airplanes do regular loops to form a network around the world. They never have to come down except for maintenance since they are refilled by the drone ships. This means there are always planes above to go to. We dock with the airplane and I get out.
I find a seat and look out the window. It is beautiful to look down on a miniature version of the world. I get a notification from my app that in 10 minutes we are crossing paths with the transatlantic loop. I am instructed to wait in the elevator for my transfer, and like a good boy, I do as I'm told.
We get to the transatlantic loop and the plane is a bit more comfortable. They even have snacks and meals for sale. I usually get something because these trips are long and I always forget to bring food.
I spend the plane ride watching videos on my phone with the help of a VR headset gluing it to my face. Before I know it, I get another notification telling me we are nearing the French loop. Again I go wait in the elevator. The plane has a bunch of different faces by the time I go, since we already met the UK loop and the Eurasia loop to exchange passengers.

The only way I can see myself doing that is if I were provided a web based programming experience that was better than coding on metal.
Enter Bryan&amp;rsquo;s fantasy world, where a flourishing space economy affords us with cheap vacations to the moon and once a year visits to grandma on the mars colony. Err&amp;hellip; I mean where there is a really cool way to work on code in the cloud.
I started my version of this in 2012 in meteorjs, I called the project meteorite (everyone who knows meteor is laughing at me right now). It was a very primitive project where you start a meteor server and others could load it up and collaborate on changes that synced to your filesystem.
I recently started giving it a once over to see if I could get it up to snuff for my recent ideas on tightening the communication gap in something like a git workflow.
As I pulled the open source threads I found many projects from a github account by the name of mad-eye useful. After I quick search, I realized it was because they were doing exactly what I was trying to do.
I was about to abandon the idea when I thought about how receptive my company is to feedback and suggestions from customers. So here it is, my first of what will hopefully be many wishlists.
Wishlist
A single source of truth that my whole team can work on simultaneously The ability for each team member to live check out a version of the codebase that has either been vetted or written by that member The ability to live check out a version of the codebase that has been vetted by every member of the team (for production) The ability to accept changes made by team members and see who has accepted which pieces of code This would mean turning most people&amp;rsquo;s git workflows inside out. Instead of patches and commits going into a central repository when a consensus is reached on their quality, they make their way from a central source of truth out to each individual&amp;rsquo;s server where they run their own version of the code with code that excludes code they have not yet accepted.
Not only would this eliminate merge conflicts
It would improve communication and make modeling complex problems a much more fluid team experience akin to working on a structure in minecraft.
Since I will probably never get around to doing this on my own, I figured I would share my two cents. Hope it makes your roadmap :-)</p><div class="action has-text-right"><a href=/2014/07/28/wishlist-coding-in-the-cloud-without-falling/ class="button is-primary">Read more</a></div></div></div><div class="column is-4"><div class=box><figure class="image is-3by2"><a href=/2014/07/27/wishlist-series/><img src=/images/default_summary_hu2be732aee21a2469ead3fe1f2df8caca_2088687_600x0_resize_q75_box.jpg alt></a></figure><h3 class="title is-5 refresh-summary-title">Wishlist Series</h3><p class=refresh-summary>Those of you who know me already know I am a man of many wishes and dreams.

My usual course of action is to abandon yet another project and move on with my life, knowing full well that it meant forgetting about the hand full of cool (from my perspective at least) feature sets I had planned for my project that did not match up with the one I found.

a corpse said to be revived by witchcraft, esp. in certain African and Caribbean religions.
Early religions lacked the scientific methods to explain everyday events and defaulted to labeling things that couldn&amp;rsquo;t otherwise be explained as witchcraft.
It is through that stretch of the definition of a zombie that allow the walkers on AMC&amp;rsquo;s The Walking Dead to be labeled zombies. Even though we know the walkers to be infected by a virus that seems to be fairly predictable, the same behavior in another culture would have been seen as witchcraft.
