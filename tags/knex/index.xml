The reason for the switch is not what I'm writing to discuss, but I'll just say that the unpredictability of mongodb was starting to become an issue in development. The thought was that if it was already difficult before the data starts pouring in, it will probably be a nightmare one the product is in use. And that meant switching from graffiti-mongoose, to my own graphql database glue.</description></item></channel></rss>
