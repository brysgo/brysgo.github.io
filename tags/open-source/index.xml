A while ago I got freaked out by the possibility of people stealing my secret keys through CI and I disabled my CI tokens on my zillion GitHub repos. It was all broken windows from there. Before I knew it my GitHub was a graveyard of packages with out of date dependencies that I had no time to update.</description></item><item><title>coming soon: peerstate</title><link>//www.brysgo.com/post/2020-08-06-coming-soon-peersta-415acc/</link><pubDate>Thu, 06 Aug 2020 08:05:02 +0000</pubDate><guid>//www.brysgo.com/post/2020-08-06-coming-soon-peersta-415acc/</guid><description>All of my open source projects start with trying to build something, getting frustrated, saying in my head &amp;ldquo;I wish I could just do this,&amp;rdquo; then obsessively investigating what it would take to be able to &amp;ldquo;just do this.&amp;rdquo;
Sometimes this inspiration comes on a work project, but more often, it comes when I am working on a side project, or playing with some new open source thing. My first example of such a project, was when I was working on an investment project called Herd.</description></item><item><title>Open Source: Chasing the Dream</title><link>//www.brysgo.com/post/2020-07-31-Open-Source-Chasing-997a1e/</link><pubDate>Fri, 31 Jul 2020 17:04:07 +0000</pubDate><guid>//www.brysgo.com/post/2020-07-31-Open-Source-Chasing-997a1e/</guid><description>I love open source. I love to imagine writing code a certain way, trying to find something that does it, failing to find said thing and building it. I love publishing it and watching people use it. I don&amp;rsquo;t love maintaining it, I don&amp;rsquo;t love the thought of having to improve it with the responsibility involved with making sure those improvements don&amp;rsquo;t break anything for anyone using your thing in a way you didn&amp;rsquo;t intend it to be used.</description></item></channel></rss>
