&lt;p>Too many massive pull requests are a smell, but sometimes big pull requests are a necessity. It is easy to come across a large pull request and immediately reject it, but you shouldn’t be intimidated by the size of a PR.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Your first job when reviewing such a PR is to identify why it is so large. Is there a large piece of functionality being added or Is a common pattern in the code being changed? Maybe the pull request is a large feature combined with pattern changes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If it is the third, I would definitely ask for the PR to be broken up. There is no reason to do a pattern change and new feature in one PR. Otherwise the actions you take will depend largely on what the reason for the PR’s size is.</description></item></channel></rss>
