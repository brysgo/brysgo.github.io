&lt;p&gt;There are only two hard things in Computer Science: cache invalidation and naming things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— Phil Karlton&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lets hold on to cache invalidation for another post&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-4-gLlF0uw&#34;&gt;…&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Naming things (or should I say labeling them&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-4-gLlF0uw&#34;&gt;…&lt;/a&gt;) is a very hard problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why is it a hard problem?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider this, imagine you are building a piece of IKEA furniture. You get all the pieces in the box and you have to put them together. Now imagine that all the pieces had a succinct description that you used to put them together. Now imagine that you couldn’t see or feel the pieces and all you had to work with were these descriptions.&lt;/p&gt;

It involved clearly abstracted pieces of our system being clearly and purposefully coupled. If this doesn&amp;rsquo;t bring you to your knees let me try and illustrate why this is so bad.
You are the kind of developer that pardon my french, &amp;ldquo;gets shit done.&amp;rdquo; Because you are such a doer, you connect the first input with the desired output. You repeat this with a different input and output a few times.</description></item></channel></rss>
