There are only two hard things in Computer Science: cache invalidation and
naming things.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>— Phil Karlton&lt;/p>

&lt;p>
Lets hold on to cache invalidation for another post&lt;a

&lt;p>
Naming things (or should I say labeling them&lt;a

>…&lt;/a
>) is a very hard problem.
&lt;/p>
&lt;h2>Why is it a hard problem?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>
Consider this, imagine you are building a piece of IKEA furniture. You get all
the pieces in the box and you have to put them together. Now imagine that all
the pieces had a succinct description that you used to put them together. Now
imagine that you couldn’t see or feel the pieces and all you had to work with
were these descriptions.
&lt;/p>

It involved clearly abstracted pieces of our system being clearly and purposefully coupled. If this doesn&amp;rsquo;t bring you to your knees let me try and illustrate why this is so bad. You are the kind of developer that pardon my french, &amp;ldquo;gets shit done.&amp;rdquo; Because you are such a doer, you connect the first input with the desired output.</description></item></channel></rss>
